## 1\. Goblin Camp
[Session 04/Goblin Camp](../session-04/outline.md#1-goblin-camp)

## 2\. Mirstone
> Those at Mirstone are too content with life to believe that a goblin invasion is really a possibility. They've seen goblins here and they're before and have no fear of them whatsoever. It's a small enough town that they can see Lethuia if they ask. Lethuia is at The Wanton Scoundrel.
> [Lethuia](../Characters/Common%20Era/Stormpieke/Mirstone/Lethuia.html)

You walk into The Wanton Scroundrel and you see a womand matching Lethuia's description to the right. She has just finished arm wrestling a rather well built looking man who seems to still be in good spirits despite losing to her. She sweeps the coins off the table and into her coin purse and they continue talking.
> The man is William, the enforcer for the local church.
> When the party asks for Lethuia he will excuse himself, saying that Lethuia's duty calls and that he will go get them some drinks.

I'll talk over a game of No One's Dice.
> She pulls another pouch from her belt and drops a bunch of dice onto the table.

We'll start with 1 silver.

> At some point during the game mention her desire to have some fun again. She doesn't want to return to the world of being a mercenary, but she would love something to shake up her life. Though any mention of the goblin invasion she'll just take as a joke trying to rile her up.

### No Ones Dice
> If at any time you roll a 1, you're eliminated (hence No One's Dice)
> Everyone rolls a d6 simultaneously
> If there is someone with the highest score, they have the opportunity to hold out and stop playing. If there is a tie for the lead, no one has that option.
> Everyone rolls another d6 (unless the leader is sitting out, they don't roll). Please note this is an ADDITIONAL d6. You leave your original roll. This is a cumulative score. If you don't have a bunch of d6s, just be sure to keep a running total.
>If the leader is sitting out, and the lead doesn't change, nothing happens, and play continues with everyone rolling another additional d6. / If the leader is sitting out, and the lead does change, the original leader as an option. They can come back in by wagering an additional ante, matching their original bet. OR they can take back half their total bet rounded down (so if it's only 1c, they get nothing back), and eliminate themselves). Then the new leader has the option of sitting out or continuing to play. / If no one was sitting out, then the leader has the same option as always to sit out if they want.
>Play continues until all but one player is eliminated. If everyone gets eliminated at the same time, then all the money goes in the middle of the pot, and it carries over to the next round.

> She'll have a fun time playing and will gladly pay up any losses, but she won't/can't help with a violent solution to the goblin problem. As much as she would love a good battle, their town is just too small to get into a battle like that. She also doesn't really believe there is an invasion. Now if they bring up the idea of bringing the goblins there she will entertain the idea. She would love something new to spice of her life. She'll agree tentatively upon two conditions. One, that she likes the goblin leader and two, that the goblins keep mostly to themselves. They'll trade and be good neighbors, but no goblins living in the village.

### Lethuia and Zeeaz Meet
Lethuia will walk right up to Zeeaz (unless the goblins are overly aggressive, but they won't be unless they have been antagonized already) and begin talking to him in Goblin. She will be more trusting of Zeeaz than he will be of her. She's willing to give them a place roughly near the village, but will demand that
1. The goblins cannot live or spend recreational time in the village.
2. The goblins will be the primary military force that defends the village should the need arise.
3. As a way to socialize the two camps (and to have some fun) she proposed a regular "fight club" between the two. A championship with tournament brackets and matches over time.

Zeeaz's reaction
1. That's fine, we don't trust or want to spend time with you humans.
2. Zeeaz is not okay with this, he'll protect his own people, but this is not something he wants to sign up for.
3. Sounds intriguing, but he wants equal representation between goblins and humans for both entrants and officiators.
4. Zeeaz will also demand extra land for growing their own crops.
5. Zeeaz will also confirm/demand that he will rule on goblin territory and Lethuia will hold no sway

Lethuia
1. **She will ask the party to talk some sense into Zeeaz** (*This is the party chance to have a skill challenge and get involved in the negotiations*) about the military thing, but she will accept a regular "rent" or "tributary" payment or maybe some middle ground (such as goblin patrols/members within the militia (and under her command)).
2. Extra land? Fine. However, she wants either more payment (see 1) or a share of the crops.
3. Zeeaz can have control over his land, as long as he keeps his end of all the agreements up.

## 3\. Aercot
Aercot is a bigger city than Mirstone. They don't have as much farmland around, but they make up for that by trading for much of their food with the iron they get from the mine. You pass the mine about 30 minutes out from the city. Even without going down that path you can make it out in the distance. Generations of mining has made it a massive affair, structures built up and around the entrance, an entrance that grows wider by the year. Looking at it, it looks like a giant finger poked a hole in the ground.
Aercot itself of an ecclectic bunch of buildings. Built up over the years the southern side of the city is older buildings. Old wood and straw buldings that have been patched over time with mud bricks. The North side is built new and nicer with big hardwood timber and bricks. And off to the east is a stone castle. A defense point for Stormpieke.

> Aercot is slightly bigger than Mirstone and so the member of the Silver Court are somewhat busy and don't necessarily meet random people from out of town. But the guards will help the party if the hear about the goblin invasion.
> The only silver court member that is available to talk to the party is Dara Floshem. They'll point the party to Dara, she's at a smithy in the North District very near the castle and would be willing to talk to the party.

You follow the directions of the guard and after wandering for a bit you eventually find your way. The air around smithee is hotter than elsewhere, it must be extremely hot actually inside the building. There's a man working at the forge itself. You guess he must be the head smith by the way he is barking out orders to others in there. Just outside the building is Dara, off to the side. She is watching the work.

>  She is willing to believe the party if they have any proof and/or are convincing. But it doesn't help the party too much... If true they are on the border of the mountains and can't afford to send out much in the way of force to help, they'll need to protect the border and possibly counter invade into the mountains. She will provide a letter of introduction to Dabbledob Dunben of Coawood. He has sway in the military and is just crazy enough to help the party. Plus to do anything she would need to convince the other members of the Silver Court to do anythign too.

## 4\. Coawood
Coawood dwarves the other two towns you have been to, this is a city, perhaps even a metropolis. It's easy to see why this is the capital. As you walk into the city you can see preparations for the fall festival everywhere. All kinds of temporary stands have popped up selling foods and trinkets of all kinds. Streamers are strung between the buildings and down the streets. Crowds mill about and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.

> Asking around it's pretty easy to find out that Dunben has been spending most of his time at the arena for the last week. Both participating and watching. Upon ariving at the arena his personal guards will block the party from seeing him without an introduction.

You can tell when you're getting close to the arena. The crowd is getting thicker and the noise even louder. And around the corner you can see it down the road. A big cicular stone structure with crowds streaming into it's many entrances.

> The guard walks you along some back corridors that are eerily quiet compared to the loud noise you just left. After a couple of turns you come to a door that he opens and lets you though. On the other side is a flat, semi private, veiwing area and sitting on an almost throne like chair is a gnome, yelling at the top of his lungs "GO FOR THE CHEST!! IN THE CHEST!!!". Down below you can see the match and a ripped Human fighter is fighting a minotaur. The human has the minotaur on it's back and in his hand is a horn, it looks like the minotaur's, and he stabs it down into the minotaur.

Dunben speaks up from behind you, good match, so what brings all of you to me? Got something you need killed?

> He will agree to help, but he's going to run the whole thing and just wants the party to guide him to the goblins. He'll take care of the rest. He won't believe the size of the camp (if the party knows the full extent) and will assume it's only half the size it is. (Meaning he won't bring enough people)
> If the party tells him a camp of 150 then he will bring 50 soldiers
> - 30 Level 1 Warriors
> - 10 Level 2 Warriors
> -  5 Level 1 Spellcasters
> -  5 Level 1 Experts(Rogue types)

### Dunben arrives at the camp
1. On the way to the camp they will come across a couple of the goblin scout/patrol parties. They'll all be killed on sight by a flurry of arrows without a chance to run.
2. When getting close to the camp his scouts will report back and give him news he doesn't like. He'll be a little shocked, worried, and be angry at the party. He's the one that didn't believe them when they said how big it is, but he doesn't remember it that way.
3. When the camp is just barely out of sight he'll stop and send in a bigger scouting party. While moving up to the camp they'll be intercepted by Zeeaz and his guards. Zeeaz's scouts have noticed the party and that is the only reason he hasn't attacked already.
3. Zeeaz will demand to know from the party what is going on (infuriating Dunben as he sees this as ignoring him and an insult).
4. Now that he has come out all this way Dunben is going to attack unless the party says something that gives him pause. Some wishy washy nonsense about getting along or peace won't cut it.

### Attack Tactics
##### Dunben
1. His group will split into separate regiments and press forward the attack on 3 flanks. Assuming that 50 soldiers were brought the three groups will be:
   1. 10 Level 1 Warriors, 3 Level 2 Warriors, 1 Spellcaster, and 1 Rogue
   2. 10 Level 1 Warriors, 3 Level 2 Warriors, 1 Spellcaster, and 1 Rogue
   3. Dunben, 10 Level 1 Warriors, 4 Level 2 Warriors, 3 Spellcasters, and 3 Rogues
2. Dunben will lead the main group straight at Zeeaz, attempting to kill him. The other two groups will flank around and attempt to head of any reinforcements from the camp.
3. If no reinforcement come or if they have killed them all (possibly with party help) then they will join the fight with Zeeaz.
4. The soldiers will not attack Zeeaz directly except to defend themselves. Standing orders is that the enemy boss is Dunben's kill and anyone stealing that from him will be killed.
5. The two extra groups can be sacrificed if it looks like Zeeaz can be killed. Dunben will retreat if his life is in danger, but he will push that "if" pretty far out of anger.
6. If Zeeaz falls Dunben will take a moment to relish in the kill and to mock the goblins. SO will the rest of the soldiers. The goblins will not let up however.
7. If Dunben falls, his soldiers will have no reason to continue fighting. Unless they've clearly otherwise got the upperhand and can easily wipe out the goblin camp, they'll assume others will run and try to run themselves. The soldiers will quickly scatter in every direction and run away.

##### Zeeaz
1. Upon leaving the camp he will have a guard of 3 hobgoblins and 2 bugbears.
2. Zeeaz's protection detail backup consists of another 3 hobgoblins and 3 bugbears. They are standing by just inside the camp and will push out straight for Zeeaz if hostilities start.
3. Another 3 groups will follow on round 3.
   - A unit of 5 bugbears, a unit of 5 hobgoblins, and a unit of 20 goblins.
   - These units will move to Zeeaz if they can, pushing extra hard to if his guards have fallen, otherwise they will attack the nearest enemy.
4. Another 3 groups will follow on round 8.
   - A unit of 5 hobgoblins and 2 units of 20 goblins.
   - These units follow the same tactics as before.
5. Finally, on round 15 the remaining fighting members of the camp will come out
   - Two units of 5 bugbears, Three units of 5 hobgoblins and four units of 20 goblins
   - These units follow the same logic as the preceding ones.
6. If Zeeaz falls the goblins will not stop, to stop is to die anyway, they will fight to the last breath. Without Zeeaz the goblins will stick together and try to win as a "ball of death".
7. If Dunben falls Zeeaz will continue the fight unless the party asks him to stop, which will earn them a temporary reprieve.
    - The goblins will move to prevent the soldiers from running away. If there are still goblins in the camp, they will come out of other entrances to try to cut off escapees. Slowly they will round up who they can. They won't stop fighting however unless Zeeaz commands it, in which case they will only fight to prevent escape or for defense.
    - Zeeaz is willing to listen as to why he shouldn't just kill the party as traitors along with the rest of the humans that have attacked his camp. The only thing that will get them out of it is a credible, actionable path to fixing his homelessness problem.
   - And no, help with the storm giants won't cut it. But if they offer he will think it sounds like an excellent idea, as a punishment! He will take them prisoner and transport them out to the mountain, letting them loose just outside of storm giant territory and making sure they go into it.
