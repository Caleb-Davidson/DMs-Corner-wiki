## 1\. HIGHTOWER MAIN ENTRANCE
> Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs come within 20 feet of Hightower

The sky has been slowly darkening all day, and the smell of rain has been thick in the air. Now it has finally begun to fall, accompanied by loud peals of thunder that seem to roll across the landscape. The sun is hidden behind massive stormclouds, and a cold wind blows from the north. As bolts of lightning begin to slam from cloud to ground and pieces of hail begin to strike the earth, the need for shelter becomes obvious. Ahead in the distance, a large tower rises from the ground, its form illuminated by the occasional lightning bolt. It seems rocky and solid, and though climbing it in this weather would be folly, it might have some outcropping that would provide safety from the storm. The only alternative is to endure the weather.

The massive tor towers above the surrounding country. A few narrow ledges offer scant protection from the elements, but a closer inspection reveals a massive, arched entryway at least 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide, set into the side of the hill. The ground just outside it slopes away from the doorway, directing the falling water out and away. Given this fact and the sturdy nature of the hill, whatever space lies beyond the door should be both dry and safe from lightning and hail. The construction seems quite sturdy, so the likelihood of collapse, even in severe conditions such as these, is remote.

**THE APPROACH**

Scattered across the ground near the entrance is the broken remains of an immense, round stone. This stone once blocked the doorway, but it was blasted apart by lightning some weeks ago. The door that it used to cover is heavy, but well counterweighted. It is unlocked and opens easily, and it swings shut of its own accord unless propped open.

> Any character who makes a DC 12 Search or Knowledge (architecture and engineering) check can determine that the stonework of the doorway and the surrounding area is indeed very strong. A dwarf can determine the same information via stonecunning.

## 2\. HIGHTOWER MAIN HALL
Each of the three doors is locked, and the DC for the required Open Lock check is high enough to be beyond the capabilities of even a talented 1st-level character. If the PCs arrive at different times, let them all get to this point before moving on to encounter 3. If they seem interested in talking, let them introduce themselves and perhaps set up camp in this chamber.

The stone chamber beyond the entrance measures at least ten paces square. Peeling paint and broken scrollwork suggest that it was once decorated with some care, but now only dust remains. Three massive stone doors—one each to the left and right, and one directly across from the entrance—lead deeper into the tor.

> Proceed to encounter 3 when they are ready to go on.
> Doors: 4 in. thick, hardness 8, hp 60, break DC 28, Open Lock 30.

## 3\. RAT RACE (EL 1/2)
> This encounter is not noted on the map. It occurs in area 2 at a time of the DM’s choosing, sometime after all the PCs have arrived there.

The sound of hissing rain, pounding hail, and howling wind from outside is interrupted only by the occasional loud crack of thunder. Still, this room seems stable enough for the most part. Even when the thunder seems to shake the very ground, not so much as a mote of dust filters down from the ceiling. The doors leading into the tor, however, do show signs of weakness, seeming to tremble with every thunderclap.
Suddenly, in conjunction with a particularly loud thunderclap, all three doors break open at once, falling from their doorways into the room with a great cacophony. Seconds later, the sounds of squeaking fill the air as a pack of rats swarms in from the largest doorway.

A bolt of lightning has opened a crevice in the next room, flooding a rat nest there.

> Panicked by the thunder and the flooding of their nest, the rats attack the nearest targets they see, though no more than three pile onto any one target. Even though a rat can deal only 1d3–4 points of damage with its bite, each such attack still deals a minimum of 1 point. If a rat is injured but not killed, it flees on its next move action.
