## 0\. Goblin Camp
[Session 04/Goblin Camp](../session-04/outline.md#1-goblin-camp)

## 1\. To The Goblin Camp


## 2\.  Lethuia and Zeeaz Meet
Lethuia will walk right up to Zeeaz (unless the goblins are overly aggressive, but they won't be unless they have been antagonized already) and begin talking to him in Goblin. She will be more trusting of Zeeaz than he will be of her. She's willing to give them a place roughly near the village, but will demand that
1. The goblins cannot live or spend recreational time in the village.
2. The goblins will be the primary military force that defends the village should the need arise.
3. As a way to socialize the two camps (and to have some fun) she proposed a regular "fight club" between the two. A championship with tournament brackets and matches over time.

Zeeaz's reaction
1. That's fine, we don't trust or want to spend time with you humans.
2. Zeeaz is not okay with this, he'll protect his own people, but this is not something he wants to sign up for.
3. Sounds intriguing, but he wants equal representation between goblins and humans for both entrants and officiators.
4. Zeeaz will also demand extra land for growing their own crops.
5. Zeeaz will also confirm/demand that he will rule on goblin territory and Lethuia will hold no sway

Lethuia
1. **She will ask the party to talk some sense into Zeeaz** (*This is the party chance to have a skill challenge and get involved in the negotiations*) about the military thing, but she will accept a regular "rent" or "tributary" payment or maybe some middle ground (such as goblin patrols/members within the militia (and under her command)).
2. Extra land? Fine. However, she wants either more payment (see 1) or a share of the crops.
3. Zeeaz can have control over his land, as long as he keeps his end of all the agreements up.

## 3\. Dunben Army arrives at the camp
1. On the way to the camp they will come across a couple of the goblin scout/patrol parties. They'll all be killed on sight by a flurry of arrows without a chance to run.
2. When getting close to the camp his scouts will report back (through communication mirrors) and give him the news that the goblin camp is much bigger then he assumed. He will order them to advance anyway.
3. When the camp is just barely out of sight the army will stop and send in a big scouting party. While moving up to the camp they'll be intercepted by Zeeaz and his guards.
3. Zeeaz will demand to know from the party what is going on.
4. Now that he has come out all this way Dunben is going to attack unless the party says something that gives him pause. Some wishy washy nonsense about getting along or peace won't cut it.

### Attack Tactics
##### Dunben
1. His group will split into separate regiments and press forward the attack on 3 flanks. Assuming that 50 soldiers were brought the three groups will be:
   1. 10 Level 1 Warriors, 3 Level 2 Warriors, 1 Spellcaster, and 1 Rogue
   2. 10 Level 1 Warriors, 3 Level 2 Warriors, 1 Spellcaster, and 1 Rogue
   3. Dunben, 10 Level 1 Warriors, 4 Level 2 Warriors, 3 Spellcasters, and 3 Rogues
2. Dunben will lead the main group straight at Zeeaz, attempting to kill him. The other two groups will flank around and attempt to head of any reinforcements from the camp.
3. If no reinforcement come or if they have killed them all (possibly with party help) then they will join the fight with Zeeaz.
4. The soldiers will not attack Zeeaz directly except to defend themselves. Standing orders is that the enemy boss is Dunben's kill and anyone stealing that from him will be killed.
5. The two extra groups can be sacrificed if it looks like Zeeaz can be killed. Dunben will retreat if his life is in danger, but he will push that "if" pretty far out of anger.
6. If Zeeaz falls Dunben will take a moment to relish in the kill and to mock the goblins. SO will the rest of the soldiers. The goblins will not let up however.
7. If Dunben falls, his soldiers will have no reason to continue fighting. Unless they've clearly otherwise got the upperhand and can easily wipe out the goblin camp, they'll assume others will run and try to run themselves. The soldiers will quickly scatter in every direction and run away.

##### Zeeaz
1. Upon leaving the camp he will have a guard of 3 hobgoblins and 2 bugbears.
2. Zeeaz's protection detail backup consists of another 3 hobgoblins and 3 bugbears. They are standing by just inside the camp and will push out straight for Zeeaz if hostilities start.
3. Another 3 groups will follow on round 3.
   - A unit of 5 bugbears, a unit of 5 hobgoblins, and a unit of 20 goblins.
   - These units will move to Zeeaz if they can, pushing extra hard to if his guards have fallen, otherwise they will attack the nearest enemy.
4. Another 3 groups will follow on round 8.
   - A unit of 5 hobgoblins and 2 units of 20 goblins.
   - These units follow the same tactics as before.
5. Finally, on round 15 the remaining fighting members of the camp will come out
   - Two units of 5 bugbears, Three units of 5 hobgoblins and four units of 20 goblins
   - These units follow the same logic as the preceding ones.
6. If Zeeaz falls the goblins will not stop, to stop is to die anyway, they will fight to the last breath. Without Zeeaz the goblins will stick together and try to win as a "ball of death".
7. If Dunben falls Zeeaz will continue the fight unless the party asks him to stop, which will earn them a temporary reprieve.
    - The goblins will move to prevent the soldiers from running away. If there are still goblins in the camp, they will come out of other entrances to try to cut off escapees. Slowly they will round up who they can. They won't stop fighting however unless Zeeaz commands it, in which case they will only fight to prevent escape or for defense.
    - Zeeaz is willing to listen as to why he shouldn't just kill the party as traitors along with the rest of the humans that have attacked his camp. The only thing that will get them out of it is a credible, actionable path to fixing his homelessness problem.
   - And no, help with the storm giants won't cut it. But if they offer he will think it sounds like an excellent idea, as a punishment! He will take them prisoner and transport them out to the mountain, letting them loose just outside of storm giant territory and making sure they go into it.
