## 1A\. HIGHTOWER MAIN ENTRANCE
> Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs come within 20 feet of Hightower

You've been out on the water all day and the sky has been slowly darkening, and the smell of rain has been thick in the air. Now it has finally begun to fall, accompanied by loud peals of thunder that seem to roll across the landscape. The sun is hidden behind massive stormclouds, and a cold wind blows from the north. As bolts of lightning begin to slam from cloud to ground and pieces of hail begin to strike the earth, the need for shelter becomes obvious. Ahead in the distance, a large tower rises from the ground, its form illuminated by the occasional lightning bolt. It seems rocky and solid, and though climbing it in this weather would be folly, it might have some outcropping that would provide safety from the storm. The only alternative is to endure the weather.

On your approach to shore you notice another boat, it's an escape boat just like yours, somebody else from your ship must have made it here before you. Getting back on land, you take a minute to stretch and get your land legs again. Looking around the tower strikes an impressice view against the country side, towering above the landscape. You spot a few narrow ledges that could offer scant protection from the elements, but head for the tower anyway.

Moving towards the tower you can see a massive, arched entryway at least 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide, set into the side of the hill. The ground just outside it slopes away from the doorway, directing the falling water out and away. Given this fact and the sturdy nature of the hill, whatever space lies beyond the door should be both dry and safe from lightning and hail. The construction seems quite sturdy, so the likelihood of collapse, even in severe conditions such as these, is remote.

**THE APPROACH**

As you approach you notice dozens if not hundreds of rats running around in the rubble scattered across the ground near the entrance. As you continue your approach the already sppoked rats scatter and run off away from the tower. The rubble appears to be the broken remains of an immense, round stone. This stone once blocked the doorway, but it was blasted apart by lightning some weeks ago. The door that it used to cover is heavy, but well counterweighted. It is unlocked and opens easily, and it swings shut of its own accord unless propped open.

> Any character who makes a DC 12 Search or Knowledge (architecture and engineering) check can determine that the stonework of the doorway and the surrounding area is indeed very strong. A dwarf can determine the same information via stonecunning.

## 3A\. HIGHTOWER MAIN HALL
Within the main hall you see three doorways, again with rubble for what used to be doors. There's still dust lingering in the air, it seems these doors were just recently broken, perhaps by whatever spooked the rats. The stone chamber beyond the entrance measures at least ten paces square. Peeling paint and broken scrollwork suggest that it was once decorated with some care, but now only dust remains.
Coming from your left is a slightly strange sight. A blue (unusual color) kobold. And behind him a friendly face, Rowan.

## 4\. PREPARATION CHAMBER (EL 1)
The long stone hall ends in a stone chamber furnished only with cracked, moldering tables on which lie rusted implements of iron. The skeletal remains of some humanoids remain at the tables, sitting as if they were eating at the table.
Rain falls into the middle of the room from a shaft in the ceiling that must run all the way to the top of the tor. From the bottom of the shaft dangles a rope, swinging slightly. A drain in the center of the floor allows the water to escape, but old, dark stains suggest that it was used to carry away other fluids long ago.
Suddenly, from a doorway on the far side of the room step two burly humanoids. Each stands more than 6 feet tall and has feral eyes and flat facial features. With a roar, the two draw their weapons and charge.

> Tactics: The two hobgoblins have no intention of honoring the storm-peace. They intend to establish a brigand camp here, and witnesses to their arrival cannot be allowed to live. The hobgoblins simply charge into combat, attacking the biggest and most threatening targets first.

> The rope does indeed lead up to the top of the tor. Climbing it requires a DC 15 Climb check. Inspection of the area surrounding the shaft’s upper opening, however, reveals only the wrecked remains of a hobgoblin camp. The shaft was dug out by tomb robbers long ago to provide easy access to the riches within the tor.

## 5\. WHAT A TANGLED WEB (EL 1)
At the end of this hallway is a small chamber whose wooden door lies on the floor. The smell of dust pervades the air, and the sound of thunder is muted here. Numerous body-shaped lumps are visible through the doorway, each wrapped carefully in layers of grey thread like woven mummies.

> The real encounter here is not the room at the end of the hall, but the short hallway itself. The door to the room has long since rotted off its hinges, and the doorway is now covered by the web of a Medium monstrous spider. Any character walking toward the doorway can make a DC 20 Spot check to notice the nearly invisible silk before walking into it. Any character who touches the web is caught as if in a net (see Player’s Handbook, page 119), except that he is also unable to move from the doorway. The web can be destroyed by blows from weapons, though any weapon that comes in contact with it also sticks to its strands (DC 16 Str check to free a weapon). Only one creature can be stuck in the web at a time.

> **Web: DR 5/—, hp 6, break DC 16, Escape Artist DC 12.**

> The spider that wove the web is hiding on the ceiling, which is also covered with nearly-invisible webbing. It gains a circumstance bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks because of the webbing.
> Tactics: The spider attacks (with surprise, if possible) as soon as a character gets stuck in or attacks the web in the doorway. It always attacks the nearest target, making no effort to avoid flanking maneuvers or eliminate more effective foes first. Since the spider is a web-spinner, it can throw webbing at targets, but it does so only if no character is currently entangled in a web.

> Once the spider has been dispatched and its webs rendered harmless, the characters can proceed into the room. The lumps in the chamber are the dead, mummified bodies of literally hundreds of rats, plus various humanoids.
> Treasure: Hidden among the mummified corpses within the room are numerous rusted weapons and tattered clothes, all of which are worthless. On the floor, however, lies a 0-level pearl of power and a bag that contains 75 gp.

## 6\. THE OFFERING CHEST (EL 1)
This room is empty save for dust and a single, small, stone chest in the center of the floor. Evidently no one has disturbed this chamber for many years.

Upon closer look the chest has an intricately ornate top, with 4 gems(black, white, gold, and clear) and some runes inscribed above.

#### *Skill Challenge (3/3)*
> First Challenge (DC 10): The first obstacle is to determine that the chest is magical and that the gems represent some sort of lock.
> Second Challenge (DC 12): Next is to decrypt the first part of the writing (Give first clue) or carefully take apart the top of the chest such that an investigation of the locking mechanism could begin.
> Third Challenge (DC 14): The last part is to decrypt the final text passage or understand the locking mechanism such that an educated guess could be made on how to place the gems.
> Failing 3 times will prevent further investigation for hints. Placing the gems in correctly will immediately end the challenge and open the chest. Placing the gems incorrectly will not trigger the trap.  Breaking open the chest or failing to pick the lock mechanism will trigger the trap.

> Hint One
> *Mi'Lord shall be first*
> *De'void shall be last*
> *Not all that are in darkness are lost*
> *Not all that have sight are found*

> Hint Two
> *Purity of heart is essential*
> *Mi'Lord wants no othe behind him*
> *Two sides of a coin*
> *Place darkness behind them*

> Answer: Gold - White - Black - Clear

> The stone chest is built into the floor and cannot be removed.
> Chest: 4 in. thick stone walls, hardness 10, hp 60, break DC 28.
> Trap: The lid of the chest is unlocked, but it is connected to a trap that fires a fusillade of darts at everyone in the same 5-foot square as the chest and in every square adjacent to it or sharing a corner with it. A character must be in the same square as the chest to open it unless she declares that she’s opening it with a weapon or pole. Attacking the chest also sets off the trap.
> Fusillade of Darts Trap: CR 1; mechanical, touch trigger (attached); manual reset;
> **Atk +10 ranged (1d4+1, dart)**; multiple targets (fires one dart at every target in a 5-ft. square adjacent to the chest);
> **Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20;** Market Price: 1,000 gp.
> Treasure: The chest contains the headband of the stout heart, two pearls (worth 100 gp each), and a small bag containing 100 gp

## 8\. THE DARK KNIGHT (EL 2)
A long, stone table dominates the center of this chamber, and bright bits of gold wink from within the dust that covers the floor. Upon the table lies the well-preserved corpse of a tall humanoid wearing the tabard and belts of a knight. Suddenly, the corpse sits up, lifting an old, rusted scimitar in one hand and a javelin in the other. As it climbs off the table, its mouth opens to loose an eerie moan.

> Tactics:  On the first round of combat, the dark knight throws his javelin, even though that action doesn’t make much sense tactically. After that, he charges to melee range and attacks the most obvious foe each round thereafter. Usually he chooses whichever PC dealt him the most damage in melee during the previous round. If the Dark Knight is disarmed or his weapon is sundered, he switches to his secondary weapon, which is slung on his back

> Humanoid Warrior Skeleton; Medium Undead; CR 2
> Hit Dice: 4d12 **24 hp**; Init: +5
> Speed: 30 ft. (6 squares)
> **AC: 15** (+1 Dex, +2 natural, +2 heavy steel shield), touch 11, flat-footed 14
> Base Attack/Grapple: +2/+3
> **Full Attack: Scimitar +3 melee (1d6+1/18–20)**
> **Full Attack: 2 claws +3 melee (1d4+1)**
> **Full Attack: Javelin +3 ranged (1d6)**
> SA: —
> SQ: **DR 5/bludgeoning**, darkvision 60 ft., immunity to cold, undead traits
> SV: **Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +2**
> Str 13, Dex 13, Con —, Int —, Wis 10, Cha 1
> Skills: —
> Feats: Improved Initiative

> Treasure: The Dark Knight has a scimitar that is cracked and nearly worthless, and his other gear (including armor) is in no better condition. But he does have a secondary weapon—a masterwork weapon of a type used by one or more of the PCs. (You can choose a weapon for a combat-based character who doesn’t already have a masterwork weapon, or you can determine randomly which of the PCs’ weapons the dark knight carries.) This weapon is worth 300 gp plus its base cost. Also within the chamber are 250 gp, scattered about loose on the floor
