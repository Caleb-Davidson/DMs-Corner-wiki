### Personality
Zeeaz doesn't have an attention problem nor a memory problem, but he is constantly changing subjects. His conversation will flow through 5 or 6 subjects before returning to a previous subject to finish it up (potentially) before continuing on to a new subject again. Despite the good beginnings to his life, he is very pessimistic. But he does not surrender or give up, he just rarely expects to succeed or win.
He discretely worships Cyric, God of murder, lies, intrigue, strife, deception, illusion. (Chaotic Evil) And would gladly serve him over the current goblin king.

Primary motivation: Survival. The character feels the way they act is they only way to get by in the world.

Secondary motivation: Thrill seeking. The character has passion for adventuring and risk.

### Backstory
Zeeaz, once a knight of the Goblin King Azog, he has been promoted to minor nobility and was given the mountains as his domain. He has reined there for 12 years already without causing any major issues for the people of Stormpieke. That is, until recently. Due to the increase in storms the Giants have been expanding their territory in the mountains and have pushed the goblins out. Leading a people without a home he did what he could, he's invading to get himself a new home.
