## 1\. Goblin Camp
Through gaps in the trees you begin to get glimpses of the camp. It is surrounded by a quickly constructed but sturdy enough wall. It's built from the trunks of trees pounded into the ground about every 10 feet and cross braces installed with more tree trunks. Thinner branches, though maybe still as thick as your arm seem to fill the remaining space. As you get closer you catch glimpses of goblins patrolling the wall from the inside. They occasionally stop to look out before continuing their patrol.

> The goblins have cleared out an area about 300 ft in diameter.
> There is about 50 buildings of various sizes (from small tents to larger blacksmith structures)
> In the center is the command building where Zeeaz spends his time. It constantly has two guards at the entrance that are armed, but normally hold the flag of the goblin king at attention.
> Small parties leave daily to go hunting and gather food. There is also a few different food stockpiles spread throughout the camp.
> There is about 150 goblins(100), hobgoblins(30), and bugbears(20) in the camp.
> The guards follow a regular schedule.
> - During the day
>   - The wall is patrolled by 6 equally spaced pairs of goblins
>   - There is about 30 seconds between pairs
>   - They switch off at dawn(A shift), lunch(B shift), dusk(A shift), and midnight(B shift)
> - During the night
>   - Same as day but with the following
>   - Additional 4 patrolling pairs that walk around the inside of the camp
>   - There is a curfew in the camp, seems to be about 10PM (a couple hours after dusk)
>   - Zeeaz's tent has a permanent guard
>   - Only half the patrols use torches at night
>     - Allowing the other half to maintain their night vision
>     - And making them harder to see

> Zeeaz has no desire to really invade Stormpieke, he isn't sure that he could win and doesn't want to lose his men. He is only here because the Storm Giants have been expanding their territory with all the storms and he's been pushed out. He just wants a place to stay, he has stayed in relative peace with Stormpieke over and is willing to do that if he can get some kind of official treaty, but he won't just trust the goodwill of some random humans.
> ###### Possible resolutions
> - Zeeaz would trust a treaty with any member of the Ruling Council of Coawood.
> - He would also accept help to retake his land, though who wants to fight the storm giants?
> - If the leader of *Mirstone* (Lethuia would find the proposal interesting if sold the right way) or Aercot wanted to accept them in (in exchange for something) he would accept that. As long as his people can retain their independence. He is willing to negotiate and give.
