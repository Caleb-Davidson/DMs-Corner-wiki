### Backstory
He is ancient, having lived many lifetimes at this point. Even he does not remember exactly at this point, when pressed he would say over 100 lifetimes. Alumaex has no care for the world at this point, being on the level of a demi-god himself, his sole concern is pure Arcana. The questions he asks and studies within the veil of power are beyond the words of mortal tongue.
When approached he will generally ignore anyone and everyone. Only those with arcane talent will peak his interest, but unless they have interesting questions or unique abilities he will quickly lose interest and retreat into his meditation again.
