## 0\. Webbed Room
The fire expands rapidly, taking a life of it's own as the hallway becomes a ball of fire. Eventually the smoke begins to clear and you can see the room at the end. Floor to cieling is covered in ash everything looks the same. Scattered around you find the charred remains of barrels and crates. Nothing of any value remains, whether because there never was anything, or because it burned up, you're not sure. As you're walking out of the room you step on a tile and notice it's loose, it could probably be pried up.

> Underneath the tile is a lever. It was hidden to protect the entrance to the ley line room. The reason this tower was originally built. When the lever is flipped, the floor along the back wall of the room retracts to reveal a staircase down to The Chamber.

You flip the lever and as you feel it click into place the floor begins to shake. A loud groaning of old gears beginning to move squeals from behind the back wall. And slowly the floor along the backside of the room retracts into the wall, revealing a staircase the leads deeper into the ground.

## 1\. The Chamber
As you enter the room a chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The walls are covered in a magnificent array of arcane runes which combine to create a symphony in stonework. The very room itself seems to pulse with power, literally, you see what seems like veins of power running to the center of the room. And in the center lays a magic circle. A large magical construction that is even now spinning and twirling. A feeling of apprehension and awe washes over you as you watch it.

> If a character attempts to approach the circle.
As you get within 10 feet of the circle you begin to feel an almost heat emanating from it. It's not hot, but the power coming from it washes over your skin and feels akin to standing next to a bonfire. You're not sure what would happen if you got even closer.
> Anyone within 5ft of the circle is subject to a magical force effect that tries to crush them. SR does not help and there is no saving throw. Each round that a creature ends next to the circle they take 20d6 - their Caster Level (if any) force damage.
> This is a major Transmutation and Conjuration effect, CL 20. The circle is designed to follow it's master and if he should ever die, place him in a temporal stasis and teleport him to a specific location.

A voice speaks from behind you. "I wouldn't do that if I was you. You would almost certainly die." Walking up from seemingly nowhere is a young lady with books floating around her. Her eyes flick to you just long enough to acknowledge your prescence before going back to the book that is open, floating in front of her.

> Ceridwen is a minor diety, tied to the domains of Magic and Knowledge. She is here because of her interest in Rhamaex and his research. Potentially to bring him into godhood with her. (She doesn't know that he has already attained a divine rank of his own accord directly from the weave). She recognizes the parties potential to be somebody someday and her passive divination magic informs her that they will cross paths again. As will they with Rhamaex. She will share some minor information about the area/events/the weave/the demons.

I am afraid that our time is done here. I'm sure our paths will cross again though. Please don't try and find this room again though, the Demons are already looking for it and now that you've found it, I shall have to hide it even better. She waves her hand at you and the next thing you know you are back in the center room of the tower, getting rained on.

## 2\. Storage
The rope is wet from rain, but is otherwise clean and strong. It's hard to make out much of the next floor, most of your view is blocked by the floor. You can just make out the top part of what seems to be a small room that is lined floor to cieling with crates and barrels.

## 3\. Storage (EL 1)
As you haul yourself up to the next floor you are assaulted by a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Looking around you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a pantry, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.
To the side you see a doorway, door propped open. Through it you see more crates, but they appear to have been thrown around and broken into, unlike the one's in here that are still nicely stacked.

Walking through the doorway, the room opens up into a larger circular area that extends behind the wall. The first thing you notice is the smell, it wreaks of alchohol, but also something else. It smells of fire, an acrid fire that's burning something nasty. In front of you is another archway, it reminds you of the one that you originally entered this tower through, but on a smaller scale. It leads to the outside. To side is a staircase leading even farther up. There is a door at the top. At the foot of the staircase is a camp, food remains littered all around, they've been here longer than this one storm. Looking closer you can make out the form of two more Hobgoblins, like the one you fought before. They're laying on the ground next to the smoldering remains of a fire. Presumably passed out drunk if the smell is anything to go by.

Upon closer inspection you see the the Hobgoblins are in fact not passed out, but dead. They have large slashes across their chest that resemble massive claws. From above you here a loud roar, it's the sound of a cornered, hurt, animal that is about to attack. A demon charges down the stairs, it's body black, burned to a crisp. It's eyes dart around the room and settle on *(whoever is between it and the door)* and charges.

> Tactics: The glabrezu is running on complete instinct, it wants to run, but will attack anything that is in it's way or that get's too close.

## 4\. Labratory
Entering the room, it feels like an old magical laboratory. You see the old remains of notes crumbled to dust. Broken glass jars that used to contain specimens, and many other magical ingredients that are all in various states of decay. This room hasn't been used in a long time. Immediately in front of you is the next staircase.

> Treasure: There's not much worth anything left in this room. Everything is too damaged from age, the elements, and previous looters. But you do manage to find 2 bright red potion vials that are still sealed and intact.

You get to the stop of the stairs and there is no door there. It's just flat wall. You swear you saw a door when you entered the room, but there is clearly no door there now.

> The door only appears when it is not beeing looked at. Hint that the PCs can see the door from the corner of their eye from time to time when they are elsewhere in the room, but when they look at it there is nothing there. Possible solutions are to have everyone close their eyes or keep their backs to the door. As long as no one can see the door then it will appear and be interactable.

## 5\. Master Quarters
You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn't as inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. There's pieces to a bed, what looks like a desk, chest, and chair. Even a stone basin tipped over in the corner.

> Treasure: After an extensive search 2 platinum pieces can be found in a piece of the bed frame.

> The stone basin is a magical containment vessel. Even tipped over none of the fluid contained in it has been spilled. It can be stood back upright and at the bottom of the basin is a locket. The fluid(liquid nullstone) poses no danger and is actually quite valuable, but can only be removed by picking it up with a container. Magical objects can be put into the fluid, but not removed from it once submerged. Non-magical objects, including hands, cannot penetrate the surface. If enough of the liquid is removed that the amulet is above the surface then it can be picked up and removed.

> A silver amulat inlaid with a white veined sapphire that is otherwise completely clear. It appears, to magical analysis, to an amulet of proof against detection and location. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.
> Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse; Price 1,000 gp
> - Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location: This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast nondetection on herself).
> Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Price 35,000 gp.
>
> This amulet is especially significant though, this amulet was created by a Demon Lord (the one that is behind the issues in the area). This amulet not only bestows negatives, but allows the Demon Lord direct access to the mind and location of the one wearing it.

> If all gathered there is 1 quarts worth of liquid nullstone. Anything completely submerged within the liquid nullstone acts as if it was inside an antimagic field (see the spell). The trapping aspect was an effect of the basin (which is also magical) rather than of the liquid nullstone. Liquid nullstone has a shelf life of one month, again, the magic of the basin is what has allowed it to keep it's efficacy up until now. Once removed that no longer applies and the liquid nullstone will become simple mercury in 1 month.
> Moderate abjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, Antimagic Field, Permanency; Price 5,000 gp per pint

## 6\. Top Floor
Cresting the staircase you realize that you have made it to the top. You can see the sky, it is night time now and the storm seems to have passed, though you can still see it still raging in the distance. The view of the countryside, bathed in moonlight, is picturesque, this would have been an amazing tower if it had been upkept. Turning to look inward you see something really strange, an old man, sitting cross legged, meditating, but floating, in the air, above the hole that goes straight through the tower. He doesn't react to your prescence, if he know's you're there, he's ignoring you.

A character with connections to the arcane can get his attention and hold it long enough to get 2-3 questions out of Rhamaex before he returns to his meditation.
