The attack happened late afternoon. Arin will inform Merrix immediately of the attack and Cannith leaders in the area will be informed over the evening.
The captives won't wake up until the next morning.
Astrid will appear himself at the mansion while the party is interrogating the 3 workers (who will wake up before Kimba)
He will speak with Kimba first (with Astrid's forced approval)

Among the random gibberish the formians will speak(and they will gladly pronounce that they are part of House Denieth and that one day Cannith will be forced to admit that Denieth is superior)

  - They stayed at an empty inn the night before the attack. There was nobody there.
  - Kimba is abusive, they have a bad relationship, and they were introduced only recently.
    - They escaped for a little bit to get some food (they were hungry) and when Kimba came and captured them, the building they were in got burned down
