Mini-session, just to move the story along some and figure out the parties next path

Justice Truegust is a 47 year old male half-elf wizard. He has a bald head and blue eyes. He sporadically squints, is very patient, and courageous to a fault.
Diana  Cloudfang is a 50 year old female human sailor. She has cropped, curled, white hair and gray eyes. She is paranoid and prone to violence, but is also very cowardly.
Bori Lavashield is a 177 year old male hill dwarf monk. He has flowing waist length golden blonde hair and golden eyes. He has soft gray skin. He stands 130cm (4'3") tall and has a beefy build
Idrinden Cromelon is a 26 year old female half-gnome bandit. She has extremely long, braided, white hair and brown eyes. She has rough chocolate skin. She stands 152cm (4'11") tall and has a round build. She has a round, incredibly cute face. She has a bland piercing on her left ear and a piercing on her right eyebrow.
Kaylein  Tuskhorn is a 35 year old female half-gnome trapper. She has very long, curled, brown hair and black eyes. She stands 190cm (6'2") tall and has a beefy build. She smokes the pipe frequently.

Kaylein got lost on the way down the stairs (she's a little too happy go lucky). She ran into the invaders and was killed by them on the spot.
The arena teams were
1: Sirius & Allred
2: Justice & Nya
3: Diana & Dio
4: Bori & Indrinden


After the attack Astrid mourns the losses, and orders a guard to find where they came from. Then if any are left alive he binds them for later questioning. Then he checks in with the party & co. Get's any wounds taken care of, and questions everyone to see if they know anything.
He will separate everyone and question them closely, somebody obviously betrayed them, because nobody should have known about the meeting today. After questioning he will apologize to the party about this and ask if they would be willing to help him with this predicament. They are technically part of the house now, and one of the few he is willing to trust at this point. So could they do some investigation and find out who was behind this? The house will make it worth their time.
After a little while the guards will report back that they have found Kaylein's body above the arena where the invaders entered from.
