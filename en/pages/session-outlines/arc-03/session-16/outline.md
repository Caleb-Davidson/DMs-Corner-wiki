## Notes
The temple was created by this portion of Manaroth's soul to imprison Haverron and prevent anyone from breaking him out (since he won't be here all the time)

Manaroth's soul was divided shortly after he died. Haverron had a partner with him that no one knew about, a cleric, and this cleric managed to split Manaroth's soul into 3 pieces. One piece was banished here to the Astral Plane, one returned to the Abyss, and one was sealed by the cleric into an amulet that he wore. He wanted to take it to his grave with him, ensuring that Manaroth would never be revived. There's not many with the power and knowledge to be able to summon Orcus. So it's easier to stop them than trying to stop Orcus.

With the locket released it will try and find it's other part, locked here in the Astral Plane. Within the temple it will go straight to the top and start a ritual to combine the two halfs. When successful Manaroth will then hunt down the party and Haverron (if released) the only escape is to get back to the Material Plane. After all Manaroth can't go back to the Material Plane without his full soul and a resurrection ritual.

The temple itself is quite large, with a number of traps and monsters within designed to stop anyone from rescuing Haverron. (And to potentially capture anyone who tried for some more torture fun, but death is acceptable too).

Manaroth is of course aware of the power of the Astral plane, and to prevent it he has made the inside of the temple a wild magic area. Causing any attempts to use magical effects, including attempting to change the world through thought causes random effects to happen as well, and sometimes, instead of.

The many monsters in here are all mindless, they aren’t actually alive beings, they are like the shadows seen before. Minimal instincts and preprogrammed actions designed by Manaroth. They were all formed in here by Manaroths will, so they don't have any sort of soul.

Haverron is being held in a dungeon below the temple to rescue him to rescue him the party must find the entrance to his cell, which is in the basement floor and underneath the giant statue. They must fight and defeat the statue. The statue will not attack first, but will wait to be attacked before making a move. It will block the first attack as it has a constantly readied guard action.

While the party is attempting to rescue him Haverron will be restricted from doing much, he can attempt to guide the party, but the monsters don’t have any active thoughts, so he can’t detect them with his mind. And he doesn’t know where he is being held. But occasionally Haveron will be able to interfere. Three times over the course of the adventure.
For the most part Manaroth will ignore the party's interference because he is trying to unite with himself. He thinks of them as so far below him that he can take care of them at his will after his business is done (and he’s not wrong). But anytime Haverron interferes Manaroth will interfere in the next fight or trap to make it even worse.

## Traps
#### Fire-Breathing Statue (Magic trap)
DC 15 spot. 30 foot cone of fire, DC 13 dex half, 4d10 damage

This trap is activated by stepping on a hidden pressure plate.
DC 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other Effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as Detect Magic, reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful Dispel Magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.

#### Locking Pit (Mechanical trap)
DC 15 spot. 2d6 fall damage. DC 20 to force door open or DC 15 to disable lock.

This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.

When a creature steps On the Cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper. Once the Pit Trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the Arcane Lock spell or similar magic.

This Pit Trap is identical to a hidden Pit Trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a Secret door nearby) opens the pit.

#### Poison Darts (Mechanical trap)
DC 15 spot. +8 ranged attack on all in 10 feet, 1d4 piercing damage. DC 15 Fort or poison 2d10

When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing The Holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged Attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this Attack roll). (If there are no Targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### The DoppelDoor  (Magic trap)

DC 15 spot. DC 15 to detect the doppelganger after having reason to be suspicious.

There is a magical doorway that teleports the first character to step through it to a locked room elsewhere in the dungeon. This effect lasts until the doppelganger dies, at which point the character is teleported to where the doppelganger perished, taking the place of its body.

When this happens, the dungeon master should take player whose character was replaced away from the group, explain what has happened, and let them play the doppelganger. The DM should give the player some basic information to inform their roleplaying, such as the doppelganger’s motivations.

Skills: Climb +9, Disguise +13, Listen +8, Spot +8
Feats: Alertness, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Focus (slam)

Adhesive (Ex): A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first.

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off.

Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.

Crush (Ex): A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.

Mimic Shape (Ex): A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the mimic’s Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.

Skills: —
Feats: —

Blindsight (Ex): An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

Acid (Ex): A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or stone.

Engulf (Ex): Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Paralysis (Ex): A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A target hit by a cube’s melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Transparent (Ex): Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.

#### Gray Ooze
Size/Type: Medium Ooze; Challenge Rating: 4
Hit Dice: 3d10+15 (31 hp); Initiative: -5; Speed: 10 ft. (2 squares)
Armor Class: 5 (-5 Dex), touch 5, flat-footed 5
Base Attack/Grapple: +2/+3
Attack: Slam +3 melee (1d6+1 plus 1d6 acid)
Full Attack: Slam +3 melee (1d6+1 plus 1d6 acid)

Special Qualities: Blindsight 60 ft., immunity to cold and fire, ooze traits, transparent
Saves: Fort +6, Ref -4, Will -4
Abilities: Str 12, Dex 1, Con 21, Int Ø, Wis 1, Cha 1
Skills: —
Feats: —

Blindsight (Ex): An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

Acid (Ex): A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The ooze’s acidic touch deals 16 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.

Constrict (Ex): A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing and armor take a -4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gray ooze must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Transparent (Ex): A gray ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a gray ooze and walk into it are automatically hit with a melee attack for slam and acid damage.


#### Black Pudding
Size/Type: Huge Ooze; Challenge Rating: 7
Hit Dice: 10d10+60 (115 hp); Initiative: -5; Speed: 20 ft. (4 squares), climb 20 ft.

Skills: Climb +11
Feats: —

Blindsight (Ex): An ooze’s entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

Acid (Ex): The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage, and the opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a black pudding also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The pudding’s acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.

Constrict (Ex): A black pudding deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing and armor take a -4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a black pudding must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Split (Ex): Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black pudding. Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
