The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors Travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same Above and Below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic Whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.



As you open your eyes from the bright light your head and body ache. It’s like getting up from a bad night’s sleep complete with groggy thoughts and everything. You look around you and it doesn’t seem like you are in the tower anymore, but it’s like you’re looking through a silver fog and can’t really focus on anything. You probably hit your head in the blast, and that’s when you remember the battle.
The fog begins to clear and you are outside the tower, the tower itself has been blown to pieces, large stones that used to be part of the tower litter the ground. Where the tower itself used to be, there is now a large crater in the cliffside. You have no idea how you could have survived such a blast, but that’s not the end of it, there are bodies everywhere. Not just hundreds, thousands, both demon and humanoid. The grass and dried dirt/mud have been dyed red with blood. There was a big battle here, too big to be the battle you were a part of, but there doesn’t seem to be anything left alive.

They are in the Astral Plane, where thought itself can affect the world around you. It’s the plain of dreams and visions. Time does not pass here and subsequently everything here is immortal and has no need to eat or drink.
Errant thoughts are not powerful enough to affect the world, only sincere direct thought or powerful thoughts/emotions. But the party is not just in any section of the Astral Plane, they are in one of the deepest sections of it and the area has just been flooded with errant magic from the battle. Not only that, but this area is close to where a shard of Manaroth has lived since his defeat in the mortal plane. The rift that formed and dropped the party into this plane was guided by the rocket.
Also the locket’s thought power exceeds that of the party, so only the most powerful thoughts/emotions from the party will have an effect on the world until the locket is destroyed.

The locket itself is not truly a sentient entity, it’s more like a small animal, it has some instincts and thought, but not full sentience. But unluckily for the party, that only works all the worse here because the only thing that the locket wants is the resurrection of it’s master and that is exactly what the locket will cause to happen here in the astral plane.

At first the party finds themselves in a scene where the Demons were successful in not only taking to the material plane, but accessing the ley line, and slaughtering thousands of people. All aspects required for the ritual to summon Manaroth into the world.

Mione calls out to the party, he’s lying on the battlefield with a large hold through his chest, seemingly from a large horn. It’s his last moments of life, about to die of a demon's poison.
Mary, Rowan, Benny! You survived, how is this possible? *coughs blood* I can’t believe you are still around, I was sure that that Balor would have crushed you in an instant.
He is surprised to see the party, they died in this version of events trying to protect the people as the demon hoard advanced. He only has a couple of questions in him, and the party does not have the means to save him, but if they do attempt to heal him it will buy some more time.

Haveron also inhabits this space though, as he died in the killing blow, his soul was trapped by Manaroth and dragged with him back into this place. Both have been trapped here together for the intervening time. The party will need to explore for a while to get a feel for what is going on. In this history all of Stormpieke has been wiped out. The towns were razed to the ground, the forest set ablaze, mass destruction and death everywhere.

As they travel, work in somehow that they don’t remember the process of traveling itself. In effect the party is fast traveling without realizing it. They wanted to be at their destination and so they were, just as a dream would go.

Similarly populate the world along the way with things that just don’t make sense, but that come from random “thoughts” from the party.

Eventually Mary will start to see things, shadows, monsters in the distance that disappear when they get closer. It’s the effect of the locket. In this space of the mind and so close to it’s master it’s attempting to take her over.
As it begins it’s possession in earnest we have a skill challenge scenario. 5 successes before 3 failures are required. DCs 10/10/15/20/20

At success 3 they are finally able to locate the issue as the magic locket they got from Rhaemax’s tower. Success 4 is for getting it off of her, and success 5 is for whoever got it off of her to relinquish it. Mary herself cannot bring her arms to remove the locket, she does not have full control over her body anymore.

If she manages to take it off or a party member does before fully possessing her then the locket will form it’s own body that looks like a dark/shadow Mary. It will then take off running into the distance. Assuming the party follows it it will lead them to a temple. The temple that Manaroth has constructed to his own name in this domain.
