## 1. Rebuilding
>As the sun sets after the battle the goblins seem to snap out of a daze all at once and get to work. Most begin repairing the wall, getting it to a defensible condition for the night. Other go to put out the few remaining fires. A few pull some big rolls of a sturdy looking gray leather(Storm Giant) out of storage and proceed to erect some makeshift tents.
>Lethuia and Zeeaz both knocked some attackers unconcious to take as prisoner, Zeeaz's personal guards bind them up and start dragging them one by one off somewhere deeper into the camp. Zeeaz speaks up:

I am going to take care of my people. The assailants won't wake up until morning, if you want to hear they're words meet me at my tent an hour after sunrise.

> There are general repairs and recovery to do all over the camp, if the party tries to help the goblins will gladly accept and offer tools and materials.
>If they work with the Storm Giant leather a DC10 check will reveal that it has slightly magical properties and is not ordinary leather. The goblins will explain that it is leather from storm giants that they have killed. If the party asks Zeeaz for some he is willing to give up a 10ftx6ft roll to the party. It is considered masterwork leather and has resistance 5 electricity.
>Lethuia will set out to help get things situated for the night in the spirit of the new treaty that she has entered into.

> If the party sleeps within the walls then they will remain safe and there will be a small disturbance at the newly fixed wall around 3 am, but whatever cause it disappeared before anyone could get a good look. It just seemed like a shadow from the witness descriptions.
>If the sleep outside the wall then about 3 am a Shadow will enter their camp and snoop around. If caught it will attempt to flee (using its incorporeal state if necessary) and will attack only if necessary.

## 2. The Interrogation

---
***Skill Challenge*** *3/2 CR3 DC 10/10/15/15/20*

There are multiple ways that information could be coerced out of the prisoners
- Intimidation (death threats, harm, imprisonment)
- Compassion (I'm on your side, I want to get you out of here)
- Bribery (let them go, gold, food)

Available pieces of data
- They encountered a few undead on the way to the goblins (not these people specifically, but some in their group did)
- Rumors of undead appearing back in the capital
- They are soldiers of Stormpieke
- They are part of an elite unit that reports directly and only to Dunben
- The group that attacked yesterday was the whole unit, to get reinforcements would mean waiting for them to come from the capital
- They don't know what Dunben's orders were, they just marched where they were told and attacked the camp on order from their superior
- They were told that Zeeaz is a cleric of Cyric
> Cyric (SEER-ik), whose titles included The Lord of Three Crowns, The Mad God, and The Prince of Lies, was the monomaniacal deity of strife and lies. After he murdered Mystra and caused the Spellplague, his immense following diminished.

Lies the will tell
- They are from Grantroc (gran-troc), a neighboring country. They noticed the goblins invading Stormpieke and came to help.
- The attack the happened yesterday was just a small part of their whole group and if they don't release them then the group will have to come back and rescue them.

> If the truth comes out then Zeeaz will see no reason to do anything about it further, he does not want to ruin his position here among humans but conversely see's no reason to help them with their undead problem.
> Lethuia has no love for the capital, she would be willing to go help the capital, but she needs to tend to her own town, and integrate the goblins. She'll add that last part as an afterthought, and then realize that she's going to have to really work on that. Her people probably won't be too happy at first.

##3. To Coawood
> Heading to Coawood from the south-east instead of the south-west like normal you come across a large graveyard outside the city. From this side you can barely see across (toward the city) and you can't across it the other direction. Looking closer to you, you see rows of tombstones standing erect in silence. With the recent talk of undead you think of the sea of dead contained here. Just as you start to panic you realize that this cemetary looks more like a park, standing in stark contrast to the images you just had flashing through your mind. There's gravel walkways that wind between tall tress, well-tended beds of shrubs and flowers, sturdy masoleums, monuments, and statues. After a moment's look you notice a man and a woman dressed in simple home-spun gray robes, trimming shrubs and pulling weeds.
> Amidst it all is a building that was once a beacon of its age, but now resembles something much more utilitarian. Nothing dramatic has befallen it, just the passing of centuries. As time went on the upkeepers obviously cared more about keeping it in good condition than they did about making it pretty or majestic. Still though, compared to it's age you would consider the building to be in good shape.

> If approached the two workers (Dalton & Pippa) will quickly direct the party to Doomguide Glandon
> **Doomguide** is the title adopted by head clerics among the faithful of Kelemvor, the diety of death and the dead. "Doom" refers not to a bleak destiny but simply to the fact that all mortals face an end to life. Kelemvor's servants ensure that the dead are properly interred and respected, and they see to the needs of the bereaved. To most of Kelemvor's faithful, raising a dead person as an undead creature is the most horrific sacrilege imaginable and an unforgivable violation of human sanctity.

> Doomguide Yovir Glandon is a thin, middle-aged, human male. He has a shaved head and a well trimmed beard that's streaking with gray. Similar to the folks outside he has a simple unadorned grass-stained grey robe. He is currently sweeping out some leaves that have made their way inside. As you approach he stops and turns to look at you,

Hello there, what service can Kelemvor's Faithful provide for you today?

> Yovir lets the praty bring up the subject of the undead themselves. While they haven't made any official announcements in Coawood yet, he is just as aware of the rumors going around as he is that he really does have an undead problem. The appearence of an adventuring party is not too surprising to him nor is it hard for him to guess what they want.

Within the last 100 years, Valhingen Graveyard has gone from being overrun with undead to teh statuesque place of rest that it is today. This is due primarily to the work of the Kelemvorites. Their order may have strengthened and waned many times over the centuries, but recently we have done well. Our concerns started about a month ago when a novice disappeared, I wasn't too concerned at first, our way of life is not the most glamorous and he would not be the first novice to run off. But then Brother Rasoran, an experienced Kelemvorite vanished. It wasn't conceivable to me that hje would just run off, he was a good friend and had been string in the faith for nearly 10 years. Then a week ago Sister Bethel disappeared and was later found... partially eaten. I'm sure that undead are again active in the catacombs below this graveyard.
I and a few others have investigated the oldest known sections of the catacombs and have found nothing. The catacombs are vast however. We have sealed them off as a precaution however.

> Yovir can reward 500 gold pieces and a set of "Googles of Night".
> Yovir asks that the adventureres do not dsiturb the resting dead within the catacombs and let their possesions be. Theft from the dead is not tolerated.
> The catacombs are extensivce, and Yovir offers the service of a guide if the part so desires it (Cassyt)

> Cassyt is a young Kelemvorite who has spent more time in her books than in the catacombs of the graveyard. Despite this, she has an unusually sunny disposition and is prone to chatter incessantly rattling off minutiae and trivia about the catacombs. She also has a dry, albeit warped, sense of humor.
