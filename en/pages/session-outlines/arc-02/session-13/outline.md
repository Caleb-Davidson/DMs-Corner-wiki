## (1) Meeting with Raikiri


The party is free to ask Raikiri their questions, he may or may not answer all of them. He asked the party here because something big is about to happen and based on the reports he has gotten the party is his best bet at getting it resolved. They are one of the most powerful groups in Stormpieke (Lethuia & co, Zeeaz, and certain members of the ruling council being the others). But they are more trustworthy than any of the others on their own. They have shown restraint and compassion to the goblins, diplomacy and tact to bring them together with a human town. ANd the strength and resolve to clear out the undead underground.

He needs the party to help with the magic circle that has appeared around the Lighthouse where they met Vilti. It’s a giant summoning circle that is similar to the effect you dealt with in Coawood before you left. It will summon an army of demons, feeding up death in the area to empower itself and continue to summon stronger demons until Stormpieke is overrun.

Normally he would want to go there himself and deal with it, but in this case he alone won’t be enough. There will be a large amount of runaway magical energy from this and he will need to control that to protect his domain. While doing that though he will be largely defenseless, so somebody will need to protect him and further somebody will need to deal with the demon and destroy the circle before the power buildup grows too strong.
That is where he needs the party's help. His elite guard can protect him, but that won’t leave enough to deal with everything else. He can provide a unit of spellcasters for the party to command, but beyond that they will need to find their own supporters and take care of the situation.
Based on how things are progressing the circle should activate itself in two weeks. So he will meet with the party at the tower the day before for preparations and final planning.



## (2) Getting help


Coawood
Dunben is the head of the military and so everyone will refer the party to him. Either because they don’t want to get involved or because they want Dunben to lose some men over this. Unless the party has a very compelling reason as to why they should help over Dunben.
Dabbledob Dunben will just be interested in getting to have a real fight, but that is balanced out of concern for his men, but also if this is real then it’s a real threat to Coawood and Stormpieke. He will be wishy washy about it, but Narbud will actually step in and remind him of the parties assistance in the goblin and undead matters as well as saving his men. After considering it a little more Dunben will help, but he is going to want info and assurances about what is going to happen. He also won’t be subservient to the party. He and he alone will command his men.

Aercot
With no relationship with the party this will be a pretty tall claim to accept. They are going to want to check it out themselves first to confirm. If the party has already talked with Dunben and gotten him on their side then Dara will already be aware of the problem, having been warned by Dunben. She will agree to send a small group of men to help if there is something in it for her.

Mirstone
Lethuia will help the party. She owes them a debt for helping the goblins and this just sounds like fun.
Zeeaz will help the party as well. He also owes them a debt and this will give him a chance to repay it.
At the inn in the town there is a rather interesting looking pair. One of them is obviously a magic caster and the other has seen his fair share of battles. Rorack (Mage) and Gito (thief) are Lethuia’s old traveling companions and they are in the area to check out the goblins after hearing about them from Lethuia. If the party approaches them and asks for help they’ll chip in as well.
