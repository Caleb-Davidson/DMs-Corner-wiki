## (1) The Library

You walk into a grand room. The vaulted ceiling is 40 feet up, a second floor is above you. Full of books and scrolls. Many of them seem simple and harmless. Some books are kept in cages, or in magic circles. One book catches your eye because it seems to just spontaneously burst into flame. But there isn’t a burn mark on it afterward.
Ahead of you the library continues quite deep. To both the left and right are wings. The left contain several lounge chairs and a simple cafe style restaurant. To the right is a giant circular desk that has several workers inside of it. You assume that is where you would rent a book. There are prices listed. You notice among the prices aren’t just books and rentals, but spells too.

At the library there are several Oracles that are available when seeking specialized information. Their services include information brokering and casting divination spells. Specifically to the parties interest there are still castings of:
Glimpse of Truth (150 gp)
The caster sees through the veil of reality to pose a single question to nameless malevolent entities that exist beyond normal consciousness.
Commune with City (280 gp)
You become one with a community that you are in, attaining knowledge of the surrounding community.
Scrying (280 gp)
Open a magical viewing portal to a distant location or creature.
Legend Lore (660 gp)
Legend lore brings to light legends about an important person, place, or thing.

What the party needs to discover here is that
That during the dragon war there was magical energy let loose upon the land due to the immense powers the elder dragons possessed. The devastation wasn’t just from their battles, but the effects it has on the environment and the world around them. It wasn’t uncommon for earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, severe storms, plagues, magic cyclones, etc… to appear randomly throughout the world as outlets for the leftover energy.
The legend they found down in the catacombs is real. The Demon Lord Zukrall was summoned into the world (using the wild energies produced by the dragon war) and
That he was a Lord serving under the Prince Orcus.
His goal while here on the material plane was to summon Orcus here as well.
The cult of orcus ruled Coawood from the shadows then. Openly it was a rule by council as it is today. But every member of the council was tied to the cult. The death of Zekrul crippled their power though, and the Kelemvorites moving in and eradicating the undead stripped the last of their powers.



## (2) Summons To Raikiri

Once the party is done in the library Vilti meets up with them one the way out and catches up. Eventually he brings up that he is here because Raikiri has taken an interest in them and wishes them to come meet him. He doesn’t really know why Raikiri wants to meet them, just that he does.




## (3) Barton and the Circle

Vilti hadn’t actually meant to meet up with the party yet, so he needs to make a stop before going to see Raikiri. Actually, the party could be helpful. There was a magic circle found in the catacombs under the city by some adventurers. A member of the Ruling Council has dug it up and intends to activate it. Viltii needs to give him a warning about how dangerous that circle actually is. Viltii doesn’t know who inscribed the circle, but he was told it dates back to the dragon war and is highly dangerous.

Upon arriving there:
As you approach you here a loud booming voice, an aging man is barking orders to about a dozen armed men. There’s lots of moving and excitement, something big is about to happen. “READY!” The man yells and everyone forms a tight circle around some large stone on the ground, it looks like a piece of the magic circle you found. “ACTIVATE” the man yells just as Vilitii yells “BARTON!”, but you are probably the only ones who heard that as a mage touches the rune on Barton’s command and it begins to glow and pulsate, emitting a loud thumping noise as it does so. It’s a tone so deep that you feel it more than hear it, and it grows stronger by the second.

Next round the first wave appears

Round 1: Dretch x2, Quasit x2
Round 2: Dretch x2, Quasit x2, Babau x2
Round 3: Hezrou x1

After each death: As X falls to the ground, a black mist seems to appear from within it’s/his/her body and stream into the rune. After a few instances of this you can tell that the rune seems to be growing stronger from this. It pulses faster and glows brighter.

After the final summon: A giant creature appears where the rune was, it almost has the face of a toad, but it looks far more menacing. Spikes cover it’s head and back. This creature feels far more powerful than the one you have previously fought
