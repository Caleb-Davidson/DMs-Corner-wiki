Government:
Venitoft is governed by the priests of the dominant temple.
Berronar Truesilver is the deity of the ruling religion. She is also known as The Revered Mother or the Mother of Safety. She is normally a dwarven God, but the religion as it is practiced here is only loosely related to the original dwarven religion. Most of the focus is on a few healing miracles performed by the local clerics (A cover up using the power from the cult of Orcus that is their true religion). Enough true believers exist that there are some true clerics of her faith, especially among the dwarves.
