## (1) Through The Portal

You run into the portal one by one, as each steps into a portal there’s a blinding flash of light and they disappear. Stepping through yourself, complete darkness follows the bright flash, and you feel a pull all over your body. Just as the stretching feeling feels like you’re going to rip, there’s another bright flash of light and the stretching feeling stops.
You appear within a small room not much bigger than the average bedroom. No window and 1 door out. Just in front of you is the red robed woman that you followed, she’s talking to a man dressed in full black leather, face mask, and an abundance of long daggers on his belt. Seeing you he asks, “friends of yours?”


The room is a single room building that is a “safe house” for the cult of orcus. The teleportation circle can be connected to by those who know of it. It allows for members who are away on tasks to easily teleport back. The safe house is not part of the greater complex, in fact it is completely disconnected and is just another random building in the town. This way if it is discovered then it doesn’t give away the main base.
The party immediately has a decision. Stay and fight, or escape. The only ways out of here are through the door (guarded by Elrod, now that outsiders have appeared his highest priority is to not let them escape) and back through the portal, which will require a Skill Challenge to reverse.

Skill Challenge - CR4 - 3 wins before 2 failures - DC 15/20/25
The portal is not designed to go out to anywhere, this is a receiving portal that can be connected to from various other places for members of the Cult of Orcus. It can be reversed to return to the last portal that connected to it though.

Tactics:
Priseria will prefer to stack back and not be in melee, if pushed into melee she will summon undead. Otherwise she will cast spells from behind Elrod. If she is reduced to half health then she will cast phantasmal killer and will abandon Elrod, running out the door.
Elrod is the guard of this safe house, he will fight until the last breath defend this place. He will back against the door to prevent the party from fleeing. He will fight to kill at first, but will take the last one or two as hostages if possible. If reduced to half health then he will take a potion of invisibility to get a major sneak attack off on the biggest target.




## (2) Out The Door


Finally seeing what awaits on the other side of the door, you come out onto a road. There are more buildings across from you and the road goes both left and right. A few humans and dwarves are walking down the street. The buildings here are on the small side, most not bigger than the one you are in. This area has seen better time with everything being a state up disarray. The stone buildings all have small to medium cracks in them. The log buildings have the occasional hole in them. The road seems to have been ploughed, compacted, and maintained at some point, but the lack of a distinct shape and the occasional weed growing suggests that it has been a few years. To your left you see a major road with more foot traffic. To your right the road narrows until it almost seems to reach a point. Further down you two inns across from each other, the only businesses you see on this street.

Outside the door is the city of Crakrough. If they made it out then either Elrod is dead or still chasing after them. If Elrod or Priseria is chasing them or otherwise still alive and they are captured by local guards they will be transferred to the Cult of Orcus base.
Elrod was about 6 hours away from his next check in. If he missed his next check in (done by a message spell) then the guards will be on high alert for any new people that have appeared today. The Cult will be after the party as well. After 24 hours the cult will have used Speak With Dead and gotten any answer they needed from Elrod to know everything that happened (if Priseria was unable to tell them).
If they’ve made it out and free from the guards then the locals are superficially nice, but would rather keep to themselves. At least in the local area. The safe house is set up in the NE corner of the town, near the Three Hills borough. It’s a poorer area of town and has several highly active criminal organizations (this being what causes the citizens to keep to themselves). As they move more towards the castle ward the area gets richer, though not necessarily more friendly. There they are in the middle of intense political upheaval between the ruling religious faction, a fundamentalist faction run by the growing dwarf population, and the judges who want to wrest political control from the church (and any religion).
The town is in the country of Vortice, which was anciently ruled by a dragon called Eldunarya. Today the dragon hasn’t been seen in centuries and the country is ruled by a vicious dictator. Lately magic catastrophes have been on the rise.




## (3) The Wrong Dark Elf


Location
Down a dingy street that narrows until it seems more like a back alley than a street, near the ruins of an old temple. Its neighbors include another old inn called The Broken Staff and the workshop of a male elf tanner named Eglindor.

Description
The inn is a small half-timbered building, with several shuttered windows. Stepping inside you overwhelmed by the smell of smoke and alcohol. There’s a fire smoldering in the corner, lending to a feeling of sweltering humid heat in the room. Most of the tables have patrons at them, most ignore you, but the few that do look at you give you looks ranging from disdain to boredom. The accommodations consist of several wooden cots in the cellar and several hammocks in the common room.

Innkeeper
The innkeeper is a slightly taller than average (4’8”) male dwarf named Urdun. He’s a very talkative man, chatting it up with the patron, moving around the room, hopping from table to table.

Patrons
Wulftroua: Female Human Paladin, Good. Wulftroua has a narrow face, with blonde hair and light blue eyes. She wears splint mail and wields a military fork. Wulftroua is hunting the warlord who stole her ancestral sword.

The woodsmen and rangers sometimes find dark hollows out at night filled with dread.
Enell was heard boasting that she has acquired a magical cloak which makes her invisible.




## (4) The Broken Staff


Location
Next to the The Wrong Dark Elf

Description
The inn is a single storey stone-walled building, with wrought iron buttresses. Stepping inside the tables and chairs are distinctly made of dwarf-wrought iron. The smell of fresh cooked bacon makes your mouth begin to water. About a quarter of the tables have patrons at them, but most that do are full of friends laughing and having a good time. Accomodations consist of a single large room with wooden cots and wooden cots near the hearth.

Innkeeper
The innkeeper is a female halfling named Mentha. She has long curly brown hair that is nearly down to the floor. Looking at you she flashes what is best described as a mischievous smile. She has an identical twin, who works opposite shifts.

Patrons
Johny Weke: Male Human Alchemist, Evil. Johny is rugged in appearance, with gray hair and amber eyes. He wears modest garments and an amulet of luminous crystal. Johny suffers a severe allergy to dogs.
Ancip Mynge: Male Human Merchant, Good. Ancip has a long face, with thin brown hair and gray eyes. He wears sturdy clothing and a wooden holy symbol. Ancip is haunted by the memories of a past life.
Bare: Male Elf Mercenary, Evil. Bare has blonde hair and hazel eyes, and numerous horrific scars. He wears leather armor and wields a battle axe and shield. Bare quietly seeks to become a vampire.

Rumors
Ealun has been missing for days, and was last known to be heading towards Plury (the town just on the other side of the Forest of Kas.
The legendary hero Ellell Hammes is held captive within the Tomb of Kas the Betrayer, trapped behind a magical door with nine seals.
The bishop of the Sanctuary of Dreams accepts bribes from adventurers for exceptions and favors.




## (5) Back Through The Portal


Back through the portal. If the party got back with 3 rounds then Cassyt will still be alive (having been left alone with the knight), but in worse condition for each round. After that the knight will try the portal, and then try to leave the dungeon. If they take longer than 5 minutes then the knight will be gone. Longer than the next morning, and the Kelemvorites will have search the tombs looking for them and found the aftermath with Cassyt dead, they will be suspected for her death.

Returned Within 3 Rounds:
As the now unfortunately familiar feeling of teleporting fades, you hear the loud scream of a young lady “Why? Please? Let me live!”. Cassyt is on the ground, bleeding from several large wounds along her back, arms, and legs. Barely alive the armored foe is standing above her, sword drawn, as if contemplating how to kill her.
Returned Within 5 minutes:
As the now unfortunately familiar feeling of teleporting fades, you hear several loud swear words from behind you and the clinking of metal armor. You turn around just in time to see the blade of a sword swinging for you.
Returned Before The Next Morning:
As the now unfortunately familiar feeling of teleporting fades, you appear in the room that you had left. The armored man that never came through the portal behind you is gone. The bodies of the undead from your fight still litter the floor, they smell even worse now than before since the magic animating them has disappeared. But there is another new body. You see Cassyt prop up sitting in a corner. She’s covered in slash wounds from head to toe. None deep enough to kill on it’s own, but as the saying goes, death by a thousand cuts.
Returned After The Next Morning
As the now new again feeling of teleporting fades, you appear in the room that you had left. But without the bodies from your fight. It has obviously been cleaned since you left. No trace remains of the fight or of the bedding and other materials that were left behind from the witch and knight that stayed here.

The tunnel leading towards the pool is covered with an illusory wall. The illusion can be discovered with a thorough search of the room or a DC 20 check. After discovering this or when otherwise trying to leave the room the Goddess will appear.




## (6) The Goddess Appears


JYou feel a rush of wind and a familiar woman appears before you. You see a woman with colored glasses, a flowing blue robe that has a hood pulled over her curly brown hair. She has several books floating around her and she is currently reading one.

If Cassyt is still alive, she immediately falls to her knees and bows before this woman, "Mi'Lady she says", before she stops moving, almost eerily still.

"My words are only for the heroes today" the woman says.

You recognize her a Ceredwin, the goddess of magic that you met at the ley line.

“I did not think that I would be seeing you again this quickly.
… Make some comment about whatever path they wound up following
This time I'm afraid that I need your help. I need you to destroy the pool of radiance that that woman was seeking, and unfortunately you (she points to Rowan) are the man to do it.”

She cannot destroy the pool herself, she is the goddess of magic and that would be against her domain, but if it isn't destroyed they will come back for it again and from it they will claw their way to the weave. It has already been separated from the weave so she doesn't fear any repercussions from destroying it.

This task might very well kill Rowan, this is not a command, but a request, and he can say no. She cannot guarantee his life, only that his sacrifice would deal a huge blow to the timeline for this cult.

Rowan was selected for this task because he drank the anti-magic liquid. He can go bathe in the pool and cancel out the power, but being in the middle if that "canceling" is not the safest place to be. In addition, even if he survives that, he will still have to deal with the mercury poisoning, even more so since it will have completely broken down by then.

If they refuse then she will let them go, they will receive no favor from her, and the cult will merely find another way to the pool.
If they accept then she will direct them through the illusion and tell them to follow it till it’s end. Once there, use this crystal “one appears in her hand”, by pressing it into the wall. It will teleport you and anyone touching it to the other side, however far it is.
they can destroy the pool. After they succeed she will appear before them again and grant them one answer to any question that it is within her power to reveal. They will also have her favor going forward, and the cult will have a major setback to their timeline.

Description of the Pool of Radiance:
"Pools of radiance are essentially raw pools of magic represented as a water-like substance. The inherent magical energies of the Weave sometimes amass in a particular place, always taking the form of a pool, whether in the middle of a desert or in a secluded grove."
"The pool itself can be used as a source from which those highly attuned to magic can bolster their abilities with incredible power. More often than not, mages attempting to use a pool to fuel their magic find themselves dealing with magical backlashes and strange side effects. Nevertheless, the pools are among the most potent sources of magical energy in all of the material plane."


## (7) The Pool

With a little hesitation, you step through the illusion. Even knowing it’s fake it’s a little unsettling to see your own legs disappearing into stone. But it’s quickly over and you're through. The other side is a quickly and roughly carved tunnel, big enough for 1 person to walk comfortably, or two if squished. You follow the tunnel for one hour, then two. You notice that every so often there is a discarded chisel or hammer that has been worn down to unusable. A third hour passes and you begin to wonder if this will ever end, but eventually you see it, an end to the tunnel. You also hear the distinctive sound of steel on stone.

At the end of the tunnel is a zombie. It’s hands and even part of the forearm have been worn down by the continuous pounding. The chisel and hammer it’s using now are nearly worn down to the handle, and have been embedded into what’s left of the end of the creature’s arms from use.

Skill Challenge - CR 5
This is a 3 part challenge that starts with inspecting the pool, approaching the pool, and surviving the pool. In parts two and three there is not a complete failure condition (except death), each step has a failure consequence, but is passed on a success or failure.

Inspecting The Pool of Radiance - 3 wins before 2 failures - DC 15/15/15
The pool is leaking power into the area, occasionally raw tendrils of magic spark up from the pool and dissipate into the air or walls.
The magic sparks are themselves spells, and being touched by them could be beneficial or harmful depending on the magic that was imbued into the spark.
By looking closely at the pool it should be possible to conclude what school of magic is building up within it and thus what school the next spark should be.

Approaching The Pool of Radiance - 4 wins before 2 failures - DC 15/15/15/15
Beginning to approach the pool kicks jumpstarts the effects (due to the introduction of either more magic or anti-magic depending on the character). But before that you need to avoid the droplet of the pool that have formed mini pools around the exterior on the approach.
Stepping into any pool causes a flaming sphere to appear on that spot
The ground is pretty uneven closer to the pool. Years of random spell effects have produced very difficult terrain, making it very easy to trip and fall.
Falling down cause a splash into multiple pools firing off a 4d6 chain lightning
Getting closer to the pool, you begin to feel the magic in the air. The hair on your arms and legs stands on end. Goosebumps erupt all over your body. It will take a strong reason to keep moving forward.
Failure causes disadvantage on check 4
A mere step from the pool a spell spark forms right in front of you and as if drawn to you, jumps right at you.
Being unable to avoid it causes 6d4 pure arcane damage.

Surviving The Pool of Radiance - 7 wins before death - DC 15/15/15/20/20/25/30
Each step of this is in it’s own right a mini skill challenge to identify and counteract the spell spark. The DC is to identify the school it is from, then which spell it is, and then again to counteract it if using a skill. Sparks could also be counteracted with items or spells potentially. Of course maybe you wouldn’t want to counteract some.
Transmutation
Unholy Beast: The subject creature temporarily transforms into a being of evil. The creature gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and a +2 bonus to natural armor. Furthermore, the damage of its natural attacks increases as if it were one size category larger.
The creature's hunched over as it’s limbs and face contort, it sprouts tusks from it’s jaw and bone spurs appear all over its body. It’s fingernails/claws extend to a point, looking like long blades. The transformation finished with its eyes turning completely black.
Abjuration
Energy Buffer: This abjuration grants you protection against damage from any type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell protects your equipment as well. Whenever you are exposed to energy damage, a multi-hued aura covers your body and absorbs up to 15d6 points of whatever type of energy triggered the effect. The protective aura lasts for 1 round or until it absorbs all the damage it can, whichever comes first. Once the aura begins absorbing damage, you cannot change the type of damage it absorbs.
Many orbs of light appear around the target, flashing various colors, green, red, blue, purple, etc. The orbs combine into one big orb, then condenses from both the outside and inside until it becomes similar to an eggshell. Then the color disappears, leaving a transparent invisible shell.
Necromancy
Wrack: This spell causes your target to experience excruciating pain. For the duration of the spell, the subject falls prone and is blinded and helpless. Even when the spell ends, the subject is still shaken for 3d10 minutes.
With the final word of the spell, your chosen foe is wracked with such pain that it doubles over and collapses. Its face and hands blister and drip fluid, and its eyes cloud with blood, rendering it blind.
Evocation
Wall of Light: This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into being at any point within range. The wall is opaque to all other creatures, though you can see through it without difficulty. A wall of light has no physical substance and does not otherwise hinder attacks, movement, or spells passing through it, although it blocks line of sight for other creatures. A creature that passes through a wall of light becomes dazzled for the duration of the spell. Spell resistance applies when passing through the wall. Sightless creatures and those already dazzled are not affected by passing through a wall of light.
Deal 2d6 damage as the power surges through you to generate this spell
A blinding flash accompanies the completion of this spell as a wall of pure light springs into being.
Illusion
Phantasmal Killer: You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.
A man appears in front of you, his face is covered by a black mask that has the face of a demon on it. He steps closer to you, walking on this dreadful pool. Unable to move he leans over and your face to face, only inches between you, and he says, “I’m disappointed my boy”. You recognize that voice, it’s Jerem, the man who took care of you as an orphan. He takes the mask off and you see the face of your dear old friend, just as he takes hid dagger and stabs you through the heart.
Enchantment
Power Word Disable: You utter a single word of power that instantly reduces the hit points of one creature of your choice to 0. Any creature that currently has 51 or more hit points is unaffected by power word disable
A single word sounds within your mind, echoing back and forth, you can’t make out the word, as you try to it slips through your grasp. Then it starts to grow bigger and bigger. The pressure in your mind grows with it until it overwhelms your mind and you pass out.
Conjuration
Mass Heal: Heal one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Immediately end any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Targets: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 250 hit points of damage.
A mass of bright light erupts and condenses around everyone in the area. The energy feels soft and warm, like snuggling an angelic blanket straight from the dryer. Feelings of happiness erupt in you. Scars, grime, and dirt all disappear from your body and you are left refreshed and ready.

## ---WE ENDED HERE---




## (8) The Necropolis and Beyond

It's as if you've entered a subterranean city. The crypts here are modeled after surface homes and other buildings, although they're only about two-thirds the size of their real counterparts. Coming from somewhere to your left, you hear sounds of scratching and scraping. How far off it's coming from is very difficult to judge in these tunnels.

This section of the catacombs is where most new interments take place. As such, Cassyt and other faithful of Kelemvor are more familiar with it than with other areas. A thousand untold secrets exist in this place. It stretches for hundreds of feet beneath the surface; a person could explore its depths for days and not see all that it contains.

Rumor has it that the hidden tomb of Rhamaex, a legendary sorcerer of old that helped found Stormpieke is within this section of the catacombs, though no one has claimed to have found it.

As it is now, however, the Necropolis is infested with undead. For each hour that the adventurers spend wandering the area, roll Id4 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets. If the adventurers spend enough time down here to come across all three encounters, they do not encounter any others. Additionally, Doomguide Yovir does not ask for their assistance in clearing the rest of the catacombs.
2 Ghouls
4 Zombies
4 Skeletons
Nothing
Each hour of searching comes with a 10% chance of discovering Rhaemax's tomb




## (9) Rhaemax's Tomb

As you step into this tomb it feels different from the others. The outside was just the same, but inside is devoid of dust. A small hand broom seems to constantly go around sweeping as if by its own accord. A stone casket lay in the back of the room, made of pristine white marble, two purple gems affixed to the left and right sides.
Arcane runes are written along the seal to the casket and a circle of runes surrounds it. Bookshelves line one wall, seemingly untouched by the ages spent in here. In fact, nothing in here gives you a feel for how long it has been. You get the feeling of being in an ancient place, but everything is so clean and preserved that it could have been placed in here yesterday.

The arcane runes along the floor are just there for decoration, they serve no function other than to make the place feel more magical and to scare any would be thieves. They light up and spin around the circle if any creature attempts to go within the circle and continue to do so as long as a creature is within the circle.

The runes along the seal however are live and have two effects. The first is they are a Glyph of Suggestion: suggesting that the target not open the casket and leave the tomb, never to return. The second is a Glyph of Mass Teleportation. Only 3 uses were bound into the runes and only 1 remains. Any attempt to open the casket after overcoming the Suggestion triggers this glyph, which teleports everyone within the tomb to a random location within the catacombs and teleports the tomb itself to a second random location within the catacombs.

The hand broom is only magical within this tomb and will actively try to stay within the tomb. If removed by force the moment it leaves the tomb the magic animating it is rendered inert, and it becomes an ordinary broom until it is brought within the tomb again.

Treasure
If they choose to remove the gems from the side of the casket, they can get them out with a DC 20 Intelligence or Dexterity (Gemmaking or Slieght of Hand) check. They are amethysts worth 2500 gp each.
Most of the books are history or general knowledge books of the time (1000 years ago (This wasn't Rhaemax's first live, just one of many that he lived among humans)) not worth much on their own and you would probably get better scientific information from the local library. The history books would fascinate the right person however.
There is a Wizards Spellbook however that contains every 1st level spell within it. Approximate retail value of 5000 gp just on materials value, closer to 20,000 gp when factoring in rare or lost spells contained within. Maybe 40k gp to the right buyer with proof that it was Rhaemax's.
Also contained on the bookshelves is an Akashic Tome. An Akashic Tome is a book of books. It can contain a large number of books within it and as a standard action can become any book that it contains by naming it.

Akashic Tome: A well made leather bound book that appears at first glance to be rather ordinary. It has a strap of brass hardware and buckles to bind it shut, almost like a diary might. Upon opening it you find every page within it blank. There is no title to it, there is no ink at all within this book.
An Akashic Tome can absorb any book that it is placed against with a command word. Once absorbed the The Tome can take the form of that book, no matter what size or shape, as a standard action by speaking the name of the book followed by the command word.
An Akashic Tome is not limited to one book however! It can hold up to 1,000 books within it. It's a traveling library in your pocket.
A book can be removed from the tomb by speaking a command word while the tome has taken the shape of the book.

## (10) Conclusion


> If Cassyt is Still Alive.
With the adventurers successful in discovering the source of the undead within the catacombs, their work is done. While Doomguide Glandon insinuates that their assistance would be helpful in clearing out the Necropolis of undead. He is dismayed at the mention of a wizard in the catacombs.

Their task done, he thanks the adventurers for their work and begs the character's leave—saying he has much to discuss with his fellow clergy and the ruling council.

Doomguide Glandon is also especially pleased with Cassyt's recounting of the events that transpired. As recognition of her efforts in the defeat of the Necromancer, Doomguide Glandon inducts Cassyt into the Most Solemn Order of the Silent Shroud; the formal clergy of Kelemvor.

> If Cassyt is Dead

> If the party is not suspected in the death of Cassyt

> If the party is suspected in the death of Cassyt
When the adventurers leave the catacombs Doomguide Glandon will come up to them and ask them where they have been. He will do what he can to keep them there and get more information out of them while waiting for the guards to show up (another member of the Kelemvorites ran for them as soon as the party was seen)
