## (1) On The Road to Raikiri

The fallout with Barton.
He won’t try and explain himself to the Party, he sees himself as above that. He was trying to determine the power of the circle, how else are you going to know for sure what it does without activating it? His men were prepared, they could have handled it. But now we know and we can protect the city.
Viltii won’t be happy, but also recognizes that this man is a member of the ruling council and while he may be on the errand of Raikiri, he is not the ruling power of this city. But that doesn’t mean Raikiri won’t be hearing of this, and he will make that clear.

Raikiri’s home is in a mountain about a day's journey north-east of coawood. Along the way they scout a lone hill giant in the distance, they can attempt to go around it or take it on directly.

## (2) Meeting Raikiri

He wants to meet because of the excellent work they have done in his domain. Helping Viltii uncover the demons in the tower, rescuing the goblins and finding a place for them, curbing an undead cult. Their feats have not been small, but he needs them to help with something.
Raikiri is a serious guy, loves his people, and protects his kingdom. But he also loves his games and shows his dragon mischievous side through them. Because of this he challenges them to a set of “challenges” to assess the parties worth and to see if he can rely on them.

### (2.1) Eating Contest
Raikiri shouts “Bring out the feast!” and a door to the side of the throne room opens and a stream of kobolds come in carrying a spread of food, plates, utensils etc… A table even appears before you and soon it’s laid out with a lavish feast made for a king. Confused, you look back to Raikiri who has a table set before him as well, with equally larger food. He smiles, licks his lips, and looks back to you. “Before I can explain any farther we should share a meal together, and a word of warning, it would be very rude to not finish all the food on your plate.”

There are 9 items laid out on the table. The party can choose what they want to eat for the first round. Then they can eat their food, but when the first plate empties then you realize that it magically fills itself with food from whatever is left on the table. To win the challenge the party must eat the remaining food. (in parenthesis if Blizzard is there)
Duck Breast - DC 16 - A total of 2(4) servings
Fried Potatoes - DC 12 - A total of 3(4) serving
Mixed Greens - DC 8 - A total of 1(2) servings
Roasted Piglet - DC 16 - A total of 2(3) serving
Meat Pie - DC 14 - A total of 2 servings
Cream and Strawberries - DC 10 - A total of 3(4) servings
Venison Pottage - DC 12 - A total of 1 serving
Braised Leeks - DC 6 - A total of 4(6) servings
Mixed Berry Pie - DC 8 - A total of 2(3) servings

After the first plates are gone you realize this is going to be a long haul challenge, so you brace yourself to feel sick afterwards.
To eat a serving of food you must make a CON check equal to it’s DC. Once half the food is gone, 10(15) servings, you are starting to reach your breaking point and now half of your previous DC will carry over to the next DC. So if the last thing you ate was a Duck Breast (DC 16) then tried to eat the Braised Leeks (DC 6), then you need a DC 14 (16 / 2 + 6). Then the next round the Venison Pottage (DC 12) would be DC 19 (14 / 2 + 12). Round down any fractionals.

### (2.2) Drinking Game
The goal of the game is to be the last man standing. But there are benefits to taking out your fellow party members. If a party member manages to win, Raikiri will give that person 1,000 gold for each party member that was taken out before Raikiri.
Each player starts off with their constitution score +1d6 as their starting fortitude. (35 for Raikiri) Each drink or effect lowers that fortitude score and upon reaching 0 you are out. Raikiri also has the additional effect of any time he takes a drink everyone does so with him. Fortitude lowering effects also only have half effectiveness on him.

### (2.3) Dragons Chess
Thank you for humoring me up to this point. I’ll explain why I called you here after you pass this last challenge. I want you to beat me in a game of Dragons Chess.



He explains the storms, he cannot leave, there is a lot of power gathering at the tower, he suspects something will happen. He wants the party to go there and handle it. A magic caster unit will be sent to the tower also to assist.
