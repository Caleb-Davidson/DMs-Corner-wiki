After negotiations with Aercot it’s evening and 8 days until activation.
Everyone else will appear in the evening 2 days before.
The night before Prisiera will sneak into the camps and start a massive undead summoning spell using the power of the circle. It will activate at sunrise, probably before the armies are truly ready, causing havoc and disarray, the demon circle will start reacting to the death and will fully activate if there is a large amount of death, otherwise it will activate two hours later as it continued to build after the event.


The magic circle is a giant ring that extends well around the tower. Demons will be summoned on the circle itself. If there is no one outside the circle they will all focus inward, otherwise they will split their effort. The demons goal is to get in the tower basement and rip a “hole” in the ley line there to feed an enormous amount of power into the circle and allow it to summon a Demon Lord (Zukral, even a ley line would not be enough to bring Orcus himself into the world on it’s own).

Dara Floshem will bring several barrels of a strong explosive as the party requested.

Destroying parts of the circle will dampen or possibly even remove the summoning effect for that area, but the magic is strong enough to jump over even large gaps in the circle (and is quite dangerous for any being that gets caught in the flow.


Over time the level of the demons will slowly increase, and if Prisiera was not caught from her first attempt (which is unlikely to happen) she will be created undead from the fallen on the battlefield.

Depending on the round count ever stronger monsters can start appearing

Round 1: Zombies, Skeletons, Ghouls, Quasit, Dretch
Round 3: Babau
Round 5: Shadow
Round 7: Vrock, and a massive buildup starts appearing in one spot, and the natural summoning seems to slow (it’s storing power for a strong summon)
Round 10: Hezrou, Glabrezu, and a single Balor appears
Round 20: Balors
Round 22: Raikiri will have stored enough power to summon a massive barrage of lightning strikes to obliterate the circle (and anyone near it).

When Raikiri blasts the circle, the party should have been pushed back into the tower, the massive shock will resonate with the lay line and pulls the party into a rift. Who know’s where they will end up?
