## (1) The Necropolis and Beyond

It's as if you've entered a subterranean city. The crypts here are modeled after surface homes and other buildings, although they're only about two-thirds the size of their real counterparts. Coming from somewhere to your left, you hear sounds of scratching and scraping. How far off it's coming from is very difficult to judge in these tunnels.

This section of the catacombs is where most new interments take place. As such, Cassyt and other faithful of Kelemvor are more familiar with it than with other areas. A thousand untold secrets exist in this place. It stretches for hundreds of feet beneath the surface; a person could explore its depths for days and not see all that it contains.

Rumor has it that the hidden tomb of Rhamaex, a legendary sorcerer of old that helped found Stormpieke is within this section of the catacombs, though no one has claimed to have found it.

As it is now, however, the Necropolis is infested with undead. For each hour that the adventurers spend wandering the area, roll Id4 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets. If the adventurers spend enough time down here to come across all three encounters, they do not encounter any others. Additionally, Doomguide Yovir does not ask for their assistance in clearing the rest of the catacombs.

## (2) Rhamax's Tomb

As you step into this tomb it feels different from the others. The outside was just the same, but inside is devoid of dust. A small hand broom seems to constantly go around sweeping as if by its own accord. A stone casket lay in the back of the room, made of pristine white marble, two purple gems affixed to the left and right sides.
Arcane runes are written along the seal to the casket and a circle of runes surrounds it. Bookshelves line one wall, seemingly untouched by the ages spent in here. In fact, nothing in here gives you a feel for how long it has been. You get the feeling of being in an ancient place, but everything is so clean and preserved that it could have been placed in here yesterday.

The arcane runes along the floor are just there for decoration, they serve no function other than to make the place feel more magical and to scare any would be thieves. They light up and spin around the circle if any creature attempts to go within the circle and continue to do so as long as a creature is within the circle.

The runes along the seal however are live and have two effects. The first is they are a Glyph of Suggestion: suggesting that the target not open the casket and leave the tomb, never to return. The second is a Glyph of Mass Teleportation. Only 3 uses were bound into the runes and only 1 remains. Any attempt to open the casket after overcoming the Suggestion triggers this glyph, which teleports everyone within the tomb to a random location within the catacombs and teleports the tomb itself to a second random location within the catacombs.

The hand broom is only magical within this tomb and will actively try to stay within the tomb. If removed by force the moment it leaves the tomb the magic animating it is rendered inert, and it becomes an ordinary broom until it is brought within the tomb again.

Treasure
If they choose to remove the gems from the side of the casket, they can get them out with a DC 20 Intelligence or Dexterity (Gem making or Sleight of Hand) check. They are amethysts worth 2500 gp each.
Most of the books are history or general knowledge books of the time (1000 years ago (This wasn't Rhamax's first live, just one of many that he lived among humans)) not worth much on their own and you would probably get better scientific information from the local library. The history books would fascinate the right person however.
There is a Wizards Spellbook however that contains every 1st level spell within it. Approximate retail value of 5000 gp just on materials value, closer to 20,000 gp when factoring in rare or lost spells contained within. Maybe 40k gp to the right buyer with proof that it was Rhamax's.
Also contained on the bookshelves is an Akashic Tome. An Akashic Tome is a book of books. It can contain a large number of books within it and as a standard action can become any book that it contains by naming it.

Akashic Tome
A well made leather bound book that appears at first glance to be rather ordinary. It has a strap of brass hardware and buckles to bind it shut, almost like a diary might. Upon opening it you find every page within it blank. There is no title to it, there is no ink at all within this book.
An Akashic Tome can absorb any book that it is placed against with a command word. Once absorbed the The Tome can take the form of that book, no matter what size or shape, as a standard action by speaking the name of the book followed by the command word.
An Akashic Tome is not limited to one book however! It can hold up to 1,000 books within it. It's a traveling library in your pocket.
A book can be removed from the tomb by speaking a command word while the tome has taken the shape of the book.

## (3) We Meet Again

Finally relaxing, you begin your march out of the catacombs. It feels too long since you’ve seen open space, sunlight, the wind. Anything other than stone and darkness. Nearing the entrance you see the side tunnel that went to the now defunct summoning circle. There seems to be a light moving around in the room, you hear the occasional crunch as a small bone is stepped on and cracked.

Looking into the room you see an old man wearing red robes with arcane marks seemingly infused into them. Despite his apparent old age he moves around just fine, no cane or walking stick. He is currently kneeling down and touching the runes of the circle that are carved into the ground.

As you step into the room he stands up and looks at you. His face changes from concerned to inquisitive after looking at you and for an instant you see something in his face. It looks familiar, and then you remember, he has long flowing hair now, but you’re sure that this is Rhamax.

He greets the party. A little more talkative than he was last time. He will not introduce himself, and will only admit to being Rhamax if they bring it up. He is here because he felt the destruction of the pool and came to investigate. While here he discovered this circle and found it interesting. Just like handwriting magic can be traced back to a specific caster if you are sensitive enough to the weave and know the original caster. He is not sure who the original caster is, but a giant circle has appeared around the tower and it bears the same signature as this circle.




## (4) Out of The Tombs


With the adventurers successful in discovering the source of the undead within the catacombs, their work is mostly done. Now the catacombs just need to be cleared out. If they have also cleared out the catacombs then Doomguide Glandon thanks them for their hard work.

While listening to their report he will shed a tear for Cassyt, promising to give her a proper hero’s burial. He is also dismayed at the mention of a wizard in the catacombs. Their task done, he thanks the adventurers for their work and begs the character's leave—saying he has much to discuss with his fellow clergy and the ruling council.

Doomguide Glandon has found someone who can help with the mercury poisoning. A high level cleric at the Temple of Tymora (The Goddess of Good Fortune) has Neutralize Poison prepared. As thanks for a job well done he will cover the associated cost.

If asked about the summoning circle then he will at first ask what the party is talking about, but after explaining the room and what they found he will theorize that it probably was inscribed during The Great Dragon War. It was during that time that Coawood was in chaos and the undead roamed here. There was a cult dedicated to Zukrall at the time and they were probably trying to summon or aid him in some way.

If the party wants more information about the war or the cult then maybe they can check the library. The war especially is well known history and the history book/legends may contain some insight.




## (5) Downtime


The party takes some much needed and deserved downtime in either Coawood or Mirstone.
