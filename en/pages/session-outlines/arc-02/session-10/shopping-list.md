Commander
(Magic Item Compendium, p. 9)

Price: 2,000 gp
Property: Armor or shield
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) transmutation
Activation: —

This item looks particularly clean and bright—in fact, it almost seems to shine with its own light.
A suit of armor or shield that has this property always appears brilliant and gleaming, even in filthy or squalid conditions, though it doesn’t shed any useful light. Attempts to paint over or obscure its finish do not diminish its brightness. While wearing commander armor or carrying a commander shield, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks, and each ally within 30 feet of you (not including yourself) gains a +1 morale bonus on Will saves. However, the shiny finish makes you so noticeable that you also take a –5 penalty on Hide checks (in addition to the normal armor check penalty).


Enhancement
An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of armor or weapons. There are 5 levels of enhancement, +1 to +5.
Shields increase their armor stat by the enhancement bonus
Armor increases it’s armor stat by the enhancement bonus
Weapons increase their attack and damage by the enhancement bonus.
The cost of the enhancement bonus depends on the end result total effective enhancement bonus (certain magical effects have an effective enhancement bonus).
+1 -   1,000 gp
+2 -   4,000 gp
+3 -   9,000 gp
+4 - 16,000 gp
+5 - 25,000 gp
+6 - 36,000 gp
+7 - 49,000 gp
+8 - 64,000 gp
+9 - 81,000 gp
+10 - 100,000 gp

Elemental
A weapon can be enchanted to summon the power of an element when striking a foe. The element must be chosen as enchantment time and cannot be changed. One weapon cannot have more than one element enchanted at a time. Each level of this enchantment adds 1d6 of that element's damage to the weapon and counts as an effective +1 enhancement bonus (this also determines the cost).
The available elements are: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Acid, Sonic, and Holy

Bloodthirster Kukri
Price: 3900 gp
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) necromancy
Effective Enhancement: +2
Activation: —, free (command), move (mental)

The blade of this weapon bears red crystals carefully inlaid in intricate designs.

Every time this weapon deals damage to a living creature, it gains 1 “blood point,” which it can store for up to 1 hour. The weapon can store a maximum of 10 blood points. This effect is continuous and requires no activation.

When you deal damage to a creature using this weapon, you can activate this effect to spend up to 5 stored blood points. Each blood point you spend in this way deals an extra 2 points of damage to that creature. The weapon doesn’t gain any blood points from a strike on which you use this ability.

This weapon can also store and cast a vampiric touch spell against a creature it strikes, just as if it were a spell storing weapon (DMG 225). Any such spell cast from a bloodstone weapon is automatically empowered (as if by the Empower Spell feat). A bloodstone weapon can store no more than one such spell at any time, and it cannot store a spell other than vampiric touch.

Additionally, as a move action 10 blood points can be expended to create and store a vampiric touch spell within this weapon for later use.

When you activate the lenses, they create a 15-foot cone of bright light emanating from your eyes. Unlike normal light sources, the lenses produce no shadowy illumination.

(a standard action), it is absorbed into your mouth until you speak the proper command word to release it. While absorbed, the pearl grants you the ability to speak and understand a specific language, such as Dwarven or Draconic. Each pearl is created for a specific language, and you
can have only one pearl of speech active at a time.
In addition, while the pearl is active, it can be activated to produce a command effect once per day (Will DC 11 negates)

Command:
You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

Approach - On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

Drop - On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

Fall - On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

Flee - On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

Halt - The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.

If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

This ability can activate twice per day.


Ring of Communication (2)

Price: 3,000 gp
Body Slot: Ring
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) divination
Activation: Free (mental)
Effective Enhancement: +1

Each of these identical silver rings is inscribed with the Draconic word for friendship.

When you activate a ring of communication, for the next minute you can clearly hear any words spoken by anyone within 1 mile who is wearing another ring of communication to which you are attuned. The volume of the speech and the background noise at either end make no difference; whispers are audible above even the sounds of combat.

Any two or more ring wearers need only touch their rings together (a standard action) and speak the command word in unison to attune the rings to each other. Any number of rings can become attuned to one another in this manner, so long as all are touched together at the same time.
